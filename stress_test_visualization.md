# Adaptive Governance and Collective Intelligence: Schema Visualization

## Overview
This synthetic theory demonstrates our most complex use case, combining 5 different model types with intricate inter-component mappings, statistical parameters, and logical axioms.

## Component 1: Belief and Influence Network (Property Graph)

### Structure
```
     Agent[A1]                    Agent[A2]
    belief_state:                belief_state:
    - P(X)=0.7                   - P(X)=0.3
    - confidence=0.8             - confidence=0.5
         |                            |
         |---[influences]------------>|
         |   weight=0.6               |
         |   type=informational       |
         |                            |
         v                            v
    [receives_signal]            [receives_signal]
         |                            |
         v                            v
  InformationSource[S1]        InformationSource[S2]
    reliability~Beta(α,β)        reliability~Beta(α,β)
    bias=-0.2                    bias=0.3
```

### Belief Update Process (Bayesian)
```
Prior: P(X) = 0.7
Signal: strength=0.9, noise~N(0,σ²)
Likelihood: P(signal|X) = f(strength, noise, source.reliability)
Posterior: P(X|signal) = P(signal|X)P(X) / P(signal)
```

### Key Features:
- **OWL Characteristics**: influences is asymmetric
- **Constraints**: Row normalization of influence weights
- **Stochastic Elements**: Signal noise, source reliability

## Component 2: Institutional Payoff Matrix (N-ary Relation)

### 5-ary Relation Structure
```
institutional_game(player, action, others_profile, institution, payoff)
```

### Example Instance (2-player under Institution I1):
| Player | Action    | Others_Action | Institution | Material | Social | Normative | Total |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| A1     | Cooperate | Cooperate     | I1          | 3        | 2      | 1         | 6     |
| A1     | Cooperate | Defect        | I1          | -1       | 0      | 1         | 0     |
| A1     | Defect    | Cooperate     | I1          | 5        | -2     | -1        | 2     |
| A1     | Defect    | Defect        | I1          | 0        | 0      | 0         | 0     |
| A1     | Punish    | Defect        | I1          | -2       | 3      | 2         | 3     |

### Equilibrium Mapping
```
equilibrium_correspondence(institution, equilibrium_type, profile)
----------------------------------------
I1, nash, (Cooperate, Cooperate)
I2, nash, (Defect, Defect)
I3, correlated, [(0.6:Cooperate, 0.4:Punish)]
```

## Component 3: Governance Adaptation Sequence

### Stage Progression
```
[Performance Assessment]
    duration: 2 periods
    participation > 0.3
         |
         | IF collective_performance < 0.5 AND participation > 0.5
         v
    [Deliberation]
    duration: 3 periods
    participation > 0.5
         |
         | IF consensus_reached OR timeout
         v

    participation > 0.1
         |
         | IF performance_delta significant
         v
[Performance Assessment] <-- LOOP
```

### Transition Conditions (Logical Expressions)
- `collective_performance < threshold AND participation > 0.5`
- `timeout_reached OR consensus_measure > 0.8`
- `proposal_quality > minimum_standard`

## Component 4: Collective Intelligence Statistical Model

### Hierarchical Bayesian Structure
```
Level 3: Hyperpriors
    α₀ ~ Gamma(1, 1)
    β₀ ~ Gamma(1, 1)
         |
         v
Level 2: Agent Competence
    θᵢ ~ Beta(α₀, β₀)  for each agent i
         |
         v
Level 1: Belief Accuracy
    Xᵢⱼ ~ Bernoulli(θᵢ)  for agent i, belief j
         |
         v
Level 0: Collective Belief
    B_collective = Σᵢ wᵢ * Bᵢ
    where wᵢ = f(θᵢ, network_position)
```

### Diversity-Performance Relationship
```
Performance

    |     ___
    |   /     \
    |  /       \
    | /         \

```

### Statistical Dependencies
```
BeliefAggregation ---[conditions_on]---> CollectiveIntelligence
       ^                                          |

       +------[conditions_on]---------------------+
                     |
              CompetenceEstimation
```

## Component 5: Normative Reasoning System (Deontic Logic)

### Rule Structure
```
Rule R1: Obligatory(cooperate) IF collective_performance < 0.3
Rule R2: Forbidden(defect) IF others_cooperating > 0.7
Rule R3: Permitted(punish) IF observed(defection)
Rule R4: Obligatory(participate) IN stage="Collective Choice"

MetaRule M1: Can_Modify(R1) IF authority_required > 0.66
MetaRule M2: Priority(R2) > Priority(R3) IF conflicts_detected
```

### Logical Relationships
```
    R1 ----[implies]----> R2
    |                     ^
    |                     |
    |                [conflicts_with]
    |                     |
    v                     |
    R3 <---[implies]----- R4
```

### Inference Example (Deontic)
```
Given:
  - Obligatory(cooperate)
  - cooperate → ¬defect
  
Derive:
  - Forbidden(defect)
  
Check Consistency:
  - ¬(Obligatory(X) ∧ Forbidden(X)) ✓
```

## Inter-Component Data Flow

### Complete Integration Example
```
1. BELIEF NETWORK: Agent A1 receives signal about world state
   → Updates belief P(cooperation_beneficial) = 0.8
   
2. STATISTICAL MODEL: Aggregates all agent beliefs
   → Collective belief = 0.65 (weighted by competence)
   → Collective_performance computed = 0.4
   
3. GOVERNANCE SEQUENCE: Performance < 0.5 triggers adaptation
   → Enters "Deliberation" stage
   
4. NORMATIVE SYSTEM: Activates rule R1
   → Obligatory(cooperate) for all agents
   
5. PAYOFF MATRIX: Institution updates to include cooperation bonus
   → New equilibrium = (Cooperate, Cooperate)
   
6. BELIEF NETWORK: Agents observe new equilibrium
   → Update beliefs about institution effectiveness
   → Influence weights adjust based on prediction accuracy
```

## Query Examples Across Components

### 1. Cross-Component: Find High-Influence Competent Agents
```cypher
// Graph query
MATCH (a:Agent)-[inf:influences]->(b:Agent)
WHERE a.social_position > 0.7
WITH a, SUM(inf.influence_weight) as total_influence

// Statistical query  
SELECT a.id, competence.posterior_mean
FROM CompetenceEstimation
WHERE a.id IN {high_influence_agents}
AND competence.posterior_mean > 0.8

// Combined result
RETURN a.id as expert_influencer
```

### 2. Adaptive Governance Trigger Analysis
```sql
-- Payoff matrix query
WITH equilibrium_welfare AS (
  SELECT institution, AVG(payoff.total) as avg_welfare
  FROM institutional_game
  WHERE (player, action) IN equilibrium_profile
  GROUP BY institution
)

-- Statistical model query
, collective_metrics AS (
  SELECT timestamp, 
         CollectiveIntelligence.accuracy,
         CollectiveIntelligence.diversity_bonus
  FROM statistical_outputs
)

-- Sequence query
SELECT stage.name, 
       stage.timestamp,
       cm.accuracy as trigger_performance,
       ew.avg_welfare as current_welfare
FROM governance_stages stage
JOIN collective_metrics cm ON stage.timestamp = cm.timestamp
JOIN equilibrium_welfare ew ON stage.institution = ew.institution
WHERE stage.name = 'Performance Assessment'
AND cm.accuracy < 0.5
```

### 3. Normative Consistency Under Belief Dynamics
```prolog
% Deontic logic query
check_consistency(Institution, BeliefState) :-
    findall(Rule, 
            (institutional_rule(Rule, Institution),
             rule_activated(Rule, BeliefState)),
            ActiveRules),
    \+ (member(R1, ActiveRules),
        member(R2, ActiveRules),
        conflicts_with(R1, R2)).

% Combined with belief network
?- agent_belief(A1, cooperation_beneficial, 0.8),
   agent_belief(A2, cooperation_beneficial, 0.2),
   aggregate_beliefs([A1, A2], CollectiveBelief),
   current_institution(I1),
   check_consistency(I1, CollectiveBelief).
```

### 4. Emergent Intelligence Path Tracing
```
// Trace how individual competencies lead to collective performance
CALL {
  // Start with network structure
  MATCH path = (source:InformationSource)-[:sends_to]->(a:Agent)-[:influences*1..3]->(b:Agent)
  RETURN path, 
         nodes(path) as agent_chain,
         [n IN nodes(path) WHERE n:Agent | n.cognitive_capacity] as capacities
}

// Join with statistical model
WITH agent_chain, capacities,
     statistical.compute_joint_competence(agent_chain) as joint_competence,
     statistical.diversity_measure(capacities) as cognitive_diversity

// Compute emergence
RETURN agent_chain,
       joint_competence,
       cognitive_diversity,
       joint_competence * (1 + cognitive_diversity * diversity_productivity) as emergent_intelligence
ORDER BY emergent_intelligence DESC
```

## Validation Examples

### 1. Belief Coherence Check
```python
for agent in agents:
    beliefs = agent.belief_state.beliefs
    for b1, b2 in combinations(beliefs, 2):
        joint_prob = P(b1 AND b2)
        assert joint_prob <= min(P(b1), P(b2)), "Probability coherence violated"
```

### 2. Influence Conservation
```python
for agent in agents:
    outgoing_influence = sum(edge.influence_weight 
                           for edge in agent.outgoing_edges 
                           if edge.type == "influences")
    assert abs(outgoing_influence - 1.0) < epsilon, "Influence weights must sum to 1"
```

### 3. Equilibrium Existence (via Kakutani)
```python
for institution in institutions:
    game = construct_game_matrix(institution)
    # Check: non-empty, compact, convex strategy sets
    assert has_fixed_point(game.best_response_correspondence), "Equilibrium must exist"
```

## Performance Metrics

### Computational Complexity
- Belief propagation: O(n² × iterations) for n agents
- Equilibrium computation: O(|A|^n) for |A| actions, n players  
- Deontic reasoning: O(|R|² × |L|) for |R| rules, |L| literals
- Statistical inference: O(n × samples) for MCMC

### Storage Requirements
- Graph: ~1MB per 1000 agents with full belief states
- Payoff tensors: ~100MB for 10 players × 4 actions × 5 institutions
- Rule base: ~10KB per 100 rules
- Statistical samples: ~1GB for 10K samples × 1000 parameters

## Implementation Notes

1. **Component Isolation**: Each component can be queried/reasoned about independently
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Inter-component mappings computed on-demand
3. **Caching Strategy**: Frequently accessed equilibria and belief aggregations cached
4. **Parallel Processing**: Statistical sampling and network analysis parallelizable
5. **Consistency Checking**: Run validation constraints before any component update
