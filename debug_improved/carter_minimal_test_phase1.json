  "annotation": "President Carter\u2019s brief address frames U.S.\u2013Soviet relations in terms of democratic deliberation and strategic arms control.  Conceptually, the speech shifts national\u2010security discourse from bipolar military antagonism toward cooperative arms-limitation, while stressing the domestic legitimacy that comes from public and congressional debate.  Although short, the text introduces a compact vocabulary of Cold-War strategy, democratic oversight, and balance-of-power reasoning.",
