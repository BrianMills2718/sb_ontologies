  "description": "Schema capturing the conceptual network introduced in President Jimmy Carter\u2019s March-1977 address.  The speech presents interacting actors (states, coalitions, Congress, public), strategic processes (SALT, arms-limitation), guiding principles (balance of power, democratic oversight), and patterned relationships (antagonism, deterrence, rivalry).  A property-graph best represents this web of heterogeneous entities and directed ties.",
  "model_type": "property_graph",
  "rationale": "The theory is neither a strict hierarchy, temporal narrative, nor stepwise sequence; instead it interrelates multiple kinds of entities (actors, constructs, principles, processes) through specific strategic and deliberative relationships.  These cross-cutting links (e.g., deterrence State\u2192State, public-debate Citizen\u2192Policy-Issue) require rich typed edges and node properties\u2014capabilities unique to a property graph.",
