 Yes, there are several elements in this prompt that strongly bias toward property_graph selection:

  Primary Bias Sources

  1. Template Shows Property Graph Example
  model_type: "property_graph"
  The template explicitly demonstrates property_graph as the example, creating anchor bias.

  2. Root Properties Structure is Graph-Specific
  root_properties:
    nodes:
      description: "The concepts, actors, events, or statements in the model."
      item_type: "Entity"
    edges:
      description: "The relationships, actions, or logical axioms connecting the nodes."
      item_type: "NaryTuple"
  The template only shows nodes/edges structure, which is property_graph specific. Other model types would need different root_properties.

  3. Analytical Focus on Relationships
  - "relationships, actions, or logical axioms connecting the nodes"
  - Emphasis on discovering "classification schemes for theoretical terms"
  - Focus on cataloging "relationships, actions, operators"

  This relationship-centric framing naturally leads to graph thinking.

  4. Example Reference
  The mention of "Table 1 in Young, 1996" references a cognitive mapping paper - inherently graph-based.

  5. Missing Guidance for Other Model Types
  The prompt provides detailed guidance for property_graph structure but no examples or templates for table_matrix, sequence, tree, timeline, or
  other models.

  To Fix the Bias

  Remove the property_graph example from the template and provide balanced examples:
  # Instead of showing property_graph as the example:
  model_type: "<optimal_model_type>"
  # And provide guidance on when to use each model type

  The current prompt essentially trains the AI to follow the property_graph template rather than genuinely evaluate which model type best fits
  each theory.
