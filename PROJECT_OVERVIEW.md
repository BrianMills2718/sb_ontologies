# Project Overview: Academic Theory Knowledge Modeling

## Strategic Goal

This project aims to transform academic papers in social and behavioral sciences into structured, machine-readable knowledge representations that can be optimally modeled using diverse representation paradigms. We seek to create a unified yet flexible knowledge base that preserves theoretical richness while enabling multiple forms of computational analysis.

### Core Objectives

1. **Multi-Paradigm Representation**: Support multiple model types (graphs, tables, sequences, trees, timelines) based on each theory's inherent structure
2. **High-Fidelity Modeling**: Capture the complete theoretical vocabulary, relationships, and logical structures without oversimplification
3. **Semantic Accuracy**: Maintain proper ontological distinctions (entities vs. relationships, domain/range constraints)
4. **Computational Accessibility**: Enable diverse query methods (SPARQL, Cypher, SQL) and reasoning engines (OWL, RDF)
5. **Interoperability**: Create schemas that can be translated between representation paradigms when needed
6. **Theoretical Preservation**: Retain discipline-specific terminology and conceptual hierarchies

## Current Methodology: Three-Phase Processing

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Vocabulary Extraction
- **Goal**: Extract ALL theoretical terms from academic papers
- **Process**: Deep reading to identify concepts, relationships, actions, properties, measures, modifiers
- **Output**: Complete vocabulary with definitions, context, and theoretical categories
- **Key Innovation**: No artificial limits on vocabulary size

### Phase 2: Ontological Classification
- **Goal**: Properly categorize terms according to semantic type
- **Process**: Classify into entities, relationships, properties, actions, measures, modifiers, truth values, operators
- **Output**: Structured classification with specific domain/range for relationships/actions
- **Key Innovation**: Preserves theoretical subcategories and infers specific type constraints

### Phase 3: Theory-Adaptive Schema Generation
- **Goal**: Create appropriate knowledge representation structure
- **Process**: Select optimal model type based on theory's inherent structure:
  - **property_graph**: For theories with rich interconnected relationships
  - **table_matrix**: For classification systems, typologies, or cross-tabulated data
  - **sequence**: For stage models, processes, or ordered progressions
  - **tree**: For hierarchical taxonomies or decision structures
  - **timeline**: For temporal evolution or historical development
  - **other**: For unique structures requiring custom representation
- **Output**: Complete JSON Schema with model-specific root properties
- **Key Innovation**: Genuinely evaluates and selects appropriate model type with detailed rationale

### Key Improvements Over Legacy System
1. **Semantic Correctness**: Only relationships/actions have domain/range (not entities)
2. **Comprehensive Extraction**: ~4x more vocabulary extracted
3. **Theoretical Nuance**: Preserves subcategories like "core-construct", "process-element"
4. **Hierarchical Support**: Maintains subTypeOf relationships
5. **Complete Ontology**: Includes modifiers, truth values, and operators

## Representation Paradigms and Interoperability

### Model Type Selection Criteria
Each theory has an inherent structure that suggests an optimal representation:

- **Property Graph**: When relationships are as important as entities (e.g., social networks, causal models)
- **Table/Matrix**: When data is naturally cross-tabulated (e.g., 2x2 classifications, feature matrices)
  - Represented as n-ary relations in schema, convertible to SQL tables later
- **Sequence**: When order and progression matter (e.g., stage theories, process models)
- **Tree**: When hierarchical relationships dominate (e.g., taxonomies, decision trees)
- **Timeline**: When temporal evolution is central (e.g., historical theories, developmental models)
- **Hybrid**: When theories require multiple representations for different aspects
  - Example: Social-Ecological Systems with graph relationships AND access rights matrices
- **Statistical**: For probabilistic theories (factor analysis, SEM, Bayesian networks)
- **Logical**: For formal reasoning systems (argumentation, deontic logic, action theories)

### Computational Capabilities by Model Type

#### Property Graphs
- **Query Languages**: Cypher, Gremlin, SPARQL
- **Reasoning**: OWL-DL, RDF inference (with appropriate axioms)
- **Operations**: Path finding, centrality, clustering
- **Use Cases**: Network analysis, causal reasoning
- **Schema Features**: Flexible properties, domain/range constraints, reasoning axioms

#### Tables/Matrices (as N-ary Relations)
- **Representation**: N-ary relations in schema, preserving logical structure
- **Query Languages**: SQL (after transformation), Datalog
- **Reasoning**: Relational algebra, constraint satisfaction
- **Operations**: Joins, aggregations, statistical analysis
- **Use Cases**: Classification, cross-tabulation, feature analysis

#### Sequences & Timelines
- **Query Languages**: Temporal SQL, process algebra
- **Reasoning**: Temporal logic, event calculus
- **Operations**: Pattern matching, sequence alignment
- **Use Cases**: Process mining, historical analysis

#### Statistical Models
- **Representation**: Entities with statistical properties, relationships with parameters
- **Schema Features**: Distribution specifications, covariance structures, loadings
- **Operations**: Parameter estimation, model fitting, hypothesis testing
- **Use Cases**: Factor analysis, SEM, Bayesian inference

#### Logical Models
- **Representation**: Propositions as entities, inference rules as relationships
- **Schema Features**: Logical axioms, defeasibility conditions, inference patterns
- **Reasoning**: Description logic, first-order logic, defeasible reasoning
- **Use Cases**: Argumentation, normative systems, planning

### Interoperability Strategy
- **Unified Semantic Model**: All structures expressible as entities and n-ary relations
- **Common Vocabulary**: All models share core definitions (Entity, Role, NaryTuple, etc.)
- **Property Specifications**: Required/optional, predefined/ad-hoc, typed constraints
- **Cross-Model Mappings**: Define transformation rules between representations
- **Format Translation**: Transform unified representation to target formats (SQL, RDF/OWL, Neo4j)

### Key Design Principles

1. **Tables as N-ary Relations**: Tables represented as n-ary relations in schema, preserving logical structure while enabling SQL transformation later
2. **Properties vs Structure**: Network models differentiated by constrained vs flexible property schemas, not fundamental differences
3. **Reasoning in Schema**: Include OWL characteristics (transitive, symmetric) and axioms in definitions when theories require reasoning
4. **Hybrid Support**: Explicit support for theories needing multiple representation paradigms
5. **Statistical/Logical Metadata**: Embed statistical parameters and logical axioms directly in schema

### Example: Theory-Specific Representations

**Cognitive Mapping (Young 1996)**: Property Graph
- Concepts as nodes, causal relationships as edges
- Enables path analysis and belief propagation

**2x2 Game Theory**: Table Matrix
- Players as rows/columns, payoffs in cells
- Enables equilibrium analysis via matrix operations

**Stages of Change Model**: Sequence
- Ordered stages with transition conditions
- Enables process mining and progression tracking

**Taxonomic Classification**: Tree
