# Project Overview: Academic Theory Knowledge Modeling

## Strategic Goal

This project aims to transform academic papers in social and behavioral sciences into structured, machine-readable knowledge representations. We seek to create a unified knowledge base that preserves theoretical richness while enabling computational analysis.

### Core Objectives

1. **High-Fidelity Modeling**: Capture the complete theoretical vocabulary, relationships, and logical structures without oversimplification
2. **Semantic Accuracy**: Maintain proper ontological distinctions (entities vs. relationships, domain/range constraints)
3. **Computational Accessibility**: Enable querying, visualization, and cross-theory analysis
4. **Theoretical Preservation**: Retain discipline-specific terminology and conceptual hierarchies

## Current Methodology: Three-Phase Processing

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Vocabulary Extraction
- **Goal**: Extract ALL theoretical terms from academic papers
- **Process**: Deep reading to identify concepts, relationships, actions, properties, measures, modifiers
- **Output**: Complete vocabulary with definitions, context, and theoretical categories
- **Key Innovation**: No artificial limits on vocabulary size

### Phase 2: Ontological Classification
- **Goal**: Properly categorize terms according to semantic type
- **Process**: Classify into entities, relationships, properties, actions, measures, modifiers, truth values, operators
- **Output**: Structured classification with specific domain/range for relationships/actions
- **Key Innovation**: Preserves theoretical subcategories and infers specific type constraints

### Phase 3: Theory-Adaptive Schema Generation
- **Goal**: Create appropriate knowledge representation structure
- **Process**: Select optimal model type (graph, matrix, sequence, tree, timeline) based on theory structure
- **Output**: Complete JSON Schema with theory-specific design
- **Key Innovation**: Genuinely evaluates model type rather than defaulting to property graphs

### Key Improvements Over Legacy System
1. **Semantic Correctness**: Only relationships/actions have domain/range (not entities)
2. **Comprehensive Extraction**: ~4x more vocabulary extracted
3. **Theoretical Nuance**: Preserves subcategories like "core-construct", "process-element"
4. **Hierarchical Support**: Maintains subTypeOf relationships
5. **Complete Ontology**: Includes modifiers, truth values, and operators

## Output Schema Structure

### Standard Components
- **Citation**: Full bibliographic reference
- **Annotation**: 2-3 sentence theoretical summary
- **Model Type**: Selected representation (with detailed rationale)
- **Schema Blueprint**:
  - Title and description
  - Root properties (model-specific)
  - Comprehensive definitions with proper categorization
  - Supported modifiers/truth values/operators

### Semantic Categories
- **Entities**: Things that exist (no domain/range)
- **Relationships**: Connections between entities (with domain/range)
- **Properties**: Attributes of entities
- **Actions**: Behaviors/operations (with domain/range)
- **Measures**: Metrics and assessments
- **Modifiers**: Temporal/modal qualifiers
- **Truth Values**: Truth conditions
- **Operators**: Logical connectors

## Quality Standards

1. **Vocabulary Completeness**: Extract all theoretical terms, not a subset
2. **Semantic Accuracy**: Proper ontological categorization
3. **Domain/Range Specificity**: Use theory-specific types (Actor→Statement, not Entity→Entity)
4. **Hierarchical Preservation**: Maintain conceptual hierarchies and subtypes
5. **Model Type Justification**: Detailed rationale for representation choice

## Use Cases

1. **Cross-Theory Analysis**: Compare concepts across different theoretical frameworks
2. **Knowledge Graphs**: Build interconnected representations of academic theories
3. **Computational Modeling**: Enable simulation and testing of theoretical predictions
4. **Literature Synthesis**: Identify patterns and gaps across research domains
5. **Educational Tools**: Create interactive visualizations of complex theories

## Technical Requirements

- **LLM**: OpenAI O3 (for superior analytical capabilities)
- **Processing Time**: 1-2 minutes per paper
- **Output Format**: YAML with embedded JSON Schema
- **Debugging**: Intermediate phase outputs saved for verification

## Future Directions

1. **Automated Cross-Theory Linking**: Identify equivalent concepts across theories
2. **Validation Framework**: Automated checks for schema completeness and accuracy
3. **Visualization Tools**: Generate theory diagrams from schemas
4. **Query Interface**: Natural language queries across the knowledge base
5. **Theory Evolution Tracking**: Model how theories change over time

## Success Metrics

- **Extraction Completeness**: 90%+ of theoretical terms captured
- **Categorization Accuracy**: Correct ontological classification
- **Domain/Range Specificity**: No generic Entity→Entity relationships
- **Model Type Diversity**: Using all model types where appropriate
- **Theoretical Fidelity**: Preserving discipline-specific terminology

This project represents a significant advance in making academic knowledge computationally accessible while maintaining theoretical integrity.
