imo he wants Congress to look into military contractors black budgets to open the lid on all the tech they've hoarded and suppressed.

I'm not sure if the tech is genuinely from NHI, or if it's just the work of human inventors like Tesla and Brown and they kept it from the public by fossil fuel industries and the likes.

But I lean towards this UFO disclosure stuff being mostly a psy-op to get the public opinion on Thiel's side. All of the new age spiritual stuff about orb summoning and angelic visitations is just cover to his real agenda. He wants to control the world with that hidden technology.

And it’s to distract people til they don’t realize he installed a digital prison - the whole world- to protect elite interests.

I know he's not really "anti-establishment" like he presents himself to be. But I suspect that there is a power struggle between the PayPal mafia and the likes of Lockheed and Boeing within the MIC.

Michels' podcast is filled with PR about how those evil contractors within the government are hiding the truth from us and not letting humanity get that groundbreaking tech that will save humanity from destruction etc

Sadly a lot of people here are falling for this theater and think this disclosure movement is authentic and beneficial for humanity.

If this is true- y’all realize they have no moat anymore? If the richest private contractors are heckling the government - and they just helped Trump bomb Iran- what do you think is left for them to disclose? I think there’s just about nothing super secret anymore. Maybe specific capabilities that are impressive. But there’s nothing sci-fi physics bending tech that came from aliens imo.

But there’s a reason why they are funding spacex and biotech and ai stuff imo. And it’s not cause the dudes at Area 51 still won’t share after all this time
u/AirPodAlbert avatar

Yeah I doubt the tech is actually anti-gravity and zero point energy like the rumours say. But I wouldn't be surprised if some agencies within the MIC have more technology than they're letting on.

Doubt it's NHI either because Michels and his circle of fraudsters are trying to tie the phenomena with spiritual/religious elements like angels vs demons and all that stuff with Bledsoe's "Lady" and Pasulka's Catholic stuff.

I think Thiel is trying to start a new religious movement that's syncretic between a UFO cult and Christianity tbh. The stuff with Skywatchers and the Esalen compound point to that imo.

He's been pushing Christianity in Silicon Valley and those circles for some reason, and he's trying it to the UFO subject for some agenda. I don't exactly know what he's doing but It's probably bad news.

I think so too- I’ve thought it was a setup for them to be the “translator” class telling us what “aliens” - prob just a lame hologram with an AI script- want us to do in order to be raptured or some shit like that- all a control mechanism for a new age when religion and nationalism is losing its grip for that

The $50k Jesse Michels originally offered was offered publicly, precisely because it's an outrageous amount of money for a two hour interview, and completely out of proportion to the UFO podcast economy. He did it to call Kirkpatrick out, because he wont accept it.

He can afford it because 1. he's the biggest podcast on the topic and is able to secure sponsorship deals every episode, 2. he has significant wealth from being a successful investor or 3. Peter Thiel gave him $50k on a whim because that kind of money is nothing to Thiel.

It is in no way indicative that there's loads of money in UFO podcasting as a whole. The ones without visible sponsorship deals will be making pennies from platforms like YouTube and Spotify.

You're going to have to forgive me for being a little dense here, but, asking where does the 100k come from if the activity of podcasting UFO related content doesn't pay anything isn't slander - it's a question asking: where does the money come from if it doesn't come from podcasting....?

It's a simple question, not an indictment.

It's really not that complicated: Jesse Michels was almost certainly quite rich long before he started American Alchemy. He may or may not be funded by Peter Thiel who is wildly rich. He is also the largest podcast dedicated to UFOs, and one of very few who has regular episode sponsorship.

He can come up with $50k if he needs to, but this tells us very little about the financial position of other podcasts that are smaller, and not run by wealthy and well connected people.

So, you're saying it's a tax fiddle...?

The person with the much higher salaried job invests their personal income in a loss making venture, thereby maintaining the utility of having earned it but avoiding having to pay income tax on it due to sustained, net loss on the part of the secondary business venture.

Is this correct....?
DudFuse

3h ago

No. I didn't say any of that. You should focus a little less on trying to gotcha people and a little more on reading their comments before you respond. No amount of esoteric language is going to be more valuable than that if you actually want to have a meaningful conversation.

For the record: I would estimate that American Alchemy runs at a modest profit. Nothing close to being able to pay $50k guest fees on the reg, but it should have accumulated enough over the years to cover that as a one off expense, assuming Jesse isn't paying himself dividends or drawing a salary.

This. The guy is obviously rich and can toss in 50k if only to call out Kirkpatrick. If he would bite (which he won't) he could even donate it to a charity of his choice. Michels is a sincere and very passionate guy and I love his content even though I reached an all time high level of skepticism myself after the whole Matthew Brown thing and the Eilzondo bullshit photo. If any type of proof ever comes out I'm convinced it will be coming from a guy like Michels or uapgerb. Not from your government.

Even if he did appear, and he won't because it's clearly just Jesse wanting to get himself more attention, what is the incentive?

The show is for diehard believers who have already decided he's a liar and will not be swayed. Complete waste of time and a completely hollow - transparent - gesture.

AARO has put out its stall. It's for the people throwing their toys to disprove with, you know, compelling evidence, not muddy the water even further with nonsense like "bet you won't come on my podcast!"

The same type of stunt people get upset about when it's the James Randy challenge.

So a $100k lump sum for a few hours work plus travel time is a poor incentive because he doesn't need the money, thanks to his government salary? Probably do it in a long day, door to door.

Does that mean that people like Chris Mellon, Lue Elizondo, Jim Semivan, Jay Stratton and Tim Gallaudet are all immune from accusations of being grifters, until we can show that they're making more than $10k per hour?

The difference is, none of the names you mentioned are still working in a professional capacity.

They're all selling you something. They benefit from doing the media circuit.

Kirkpatrick is being asked to subject himself to an hour or more of Jesse screaming and rolling his eyes. If he doesn't need the money, he wouldn't do that if he still has professional aspirations.

It also assumes he hasn't signed a non-disclosure agreement preventing him from doing things like that.

Michels brought up AARO in his June 3 Joe Rogan interview, calling it, “the modern Blue Book that’s, you know, basically saying ‘don’t look here’ like ‘this is all bullshit’ or whatever. It’s run by a guy named Sean Kirkpatrick. He has all these, like, atomic connections. He, like, worked at Oak Ridge for God’s sake

Used to run. But hey this little YouTube who can get the who is who (to my knowledge one of the only ones to Interview Mr Grusch) of the UFO scene does not have connections. Next will be claims of censorship. Plays Really well with the Rogan crowd.

I always wonder if these gatekeeper types have been warned in no uncertain terms about squealing. $100k is a pittance if masked men have crept into your bedroom some random night and put a pistol in your wife's mouth in front of you as a warning about remaining silent and keeping the lie going.

Jesse would absolutely grill Kirkpatrick. Yes, he is in the pocket of Thiel, but Thiel wants disclosure simply because he wants access to the the tech. And Jesse, whatever you or I may think about his motivations, he is very well versed on this topic and a quick thinker. He would not so easily be either browbeat or bamboozled by Sean and his perception management master, Susan Gogh.

I agree with all you said, though after his soft hands on Greer, I fear we wouldn't get the level of grilling we need (and he could eviscerate him with his incredible memory and piecing things together in real time).

I think he wants to come off as a non-hostile environment for whomever comes on the show. I understand the position, just not confident it will be satisfying.

Greer got the soft hands because Greer is still, in large part, a part of the same movement towards disclosure--even if he is a grifter. Kirkpatrick on the other hand, is almost too perfect a punching bag representing the gatekeepers. I think there would be value gleaned even for the normies in this conversation. My bigger issue is that we are all likely just punching air here.

Kirkpatrick is just a useful pawn for the gatekeepers. He is the shiny thing--the Legendary LinkedIn Boss-- we in this community get attracted to to swat at and largely waste time spinning our wheels on.
