annotation: "Presents a comprehensive theory of how collective intelligence emerges from individual cognitive processes through social networks, institutional structures, and adaptive governance mechanisms, incorporating game-theoretic dynamics, Bayesian belief updating, and deontic logic for normative reasoning."
model_type: "hybrid"
rationale: "This theory requires multiple representations: (1) property graph for agent beliefs and social influence networks, (2) table matrix for game-theoretic payoff structures and institutional configurations, (3) sequence for adaptive governance stages, (4) statistical model for belief aggregation and collective intelligence emergence, and (5) logical model for normative reasoning and institutional rules."
