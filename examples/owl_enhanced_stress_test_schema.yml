citation: "Synthetic Theory. 2024. Adaptive Governance and Collective Intelligence: A Multi-level Framework for Complex Social Systems with OWL Reasoning. Journal of Advanced Social Theory 1(1): 1-50."
annotation: "Presents a comprehensive theory of how collective intelligence emerges from individual cognitive processes through social networks, institutional structures, and adaptive governance mechanisms, incorporating game-theoretic dynamics, Bayesian belief updating, deontic logic for normative reasoning, and sophisticated OWL-based automated inference capabilities."
model_type: "hybrid_with_owl_reasoning"
rationale: "This theory requires multiple representations with sophisticated automated reasoning: (1) property graph for agent beliefs and social influence networks, (2) table matrix for game-theoretic payoff structures, (3) sequence for adaptive governance stages, (4) statistical model for belief aggregation, and (5) logical model for normative reasoning. OWL reasoning enables complex class inference, property chain reasoning, consistency checking, and cross-component automated inference."
