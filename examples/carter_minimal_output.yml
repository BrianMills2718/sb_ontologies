  D.C., March 1977.
annotation: President Carter’s brief address frames U.S.–Soviet relations in terms
  of democratic deliberation and strategic arms control.  Conceptually, the speech
  shifts national‐security discourse from bipolar military antagonism toward cooperative
  arms-limitation, while stressing the domestic legitimacy that comes from public
  and congressional debate.  Although short, the text introduces a compact vocabulary
  of Cold-War strategy, democratic oversight, and balance-of-power reasoning.
model_type: property_graph
rationale: The theory is neither a strict hierarchy, temporal narrative, nor stepwise
  sequence; instead it interrelates multiple kinds of entities (actors, constructs,
  principles, processes) through specific strategic and deliberative relationships.  These
  cross-cutting links (e.g., deterrence State→State, public-debate Citizen→Policy-Issue)
  require rich typed edges and node properties—capabilities unique to a property graph.

  title: Carter 1977 U.S.–Soviet Relations Speech – Strategic-Decision Schema
  description: Schema capturing the conceptual network introduced in President Jimmy
    Carter’s March-1977 address.  The speech presents interacting actors (states,
    coalitions, Congress, public), strategic processes (SALT, arms-limitation), guiding
    principles (balance of power, democratic oversight), and patterned relationships
    (antagonism, deterrence, rivalry).  A property-graph best represents this web
    of heterogeneous entities and directed ties.
