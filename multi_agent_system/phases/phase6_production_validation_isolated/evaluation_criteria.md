# Evaluation Criteria: Production Validation

**Success Threshold**: Must achieve exactly 100/100 points to PASS

## ðŸ“Š **EVALUATION CRITERIA**

### **1. Complete System Integration (25 points)**
**Test full system integration:**
```bash
cd /home/brian/lit_review/evidence/phase6_production_validation
python working_implementation.py
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: Complete system works seamlessly from academic text to balanced multi-purpose analysis
- 0 points: Any integration failures or component incompatibilities

### **2. Perfect Purpose Balance (25 points)**
**Validate balance across all purposes:**
```bash
python production_validator.py --validate-purpose-balance
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: Equal analytical capabilities validated across descriptive, explanatory, predictive, causal, and intervention purposes
- 0 points: Any purpose imbalance or capability disparities

### **3. Production Performance (25 points)**
**Test production readiness:**
```bash
python production_validator.py --performance-test
python deployment_demo.py --production-simulation
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: Excellent performance, scalability, and production readiness
- 0 points: Performance issues or production deployment problems

### **4. Comprehensive Coverage (25 points)**
**Test theoretical coverage and quality:**
```bash
python -m pytest /home/brian/lit_review/evidence/phase6_production_validation/ -v
python production_validator.py --comprehensive-validation
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: Comprehensive coverage across theoretical domains with excellent quality
- 0 points: Limited coverage or quality issues

## âœ… **PASS CRITERIA**
**PASS (100 points ONLY)**: Perfect production-ready balanced system
**FAIL (<100 points)**: Any production readiness gaps, balance issues, or quality problems
