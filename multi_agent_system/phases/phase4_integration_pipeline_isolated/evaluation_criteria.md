# Evaluation Criteria: Balanced Integration Pipeline

**Success Threshold**: Must achieve exactly 100/100 points to PASS

## ðŸ“Š **EVALUATION CRITERIA**

### **1. Complete Pipeline Integration (25 points)**
**Test end-to-end pipeline:**
```bash
cd /home/brian/lit_review/evidence/phase4_integration_pipeline
python working_implementation.py
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: Complete pipeline processes theories from text to balanced schema successfully
- 0 points: Pipeline failures or incomplete processing

### **2. Balanced Processing Validation (25 points)**
**Verify balance throughout pipeline:**
```bash
python test_integration_pipeline.py --validate-balance
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: Equal sophistication maintained across all five purposes throughout entire pipeline
- 0 points: Any stage showing purpose imbalance or bias

### **3. Performance and Quality (25 points)**
**Test pipeline efficiency and quality:**
```bash
python test_integration_pipeline.py --performance-test
python -m pytest /home/brian/lit_review/evidence/phase4_integration_pipeline/ -v
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: High performance with comprehensive quality assurance
- 0 points: Poor performance or quality failures

### **4. Experimental Integration (25 points)**
**Validate integration with experimental findings:**
```bash
python integration_validation.py --test-experimental-components
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: Successfully integrates validated experimental components and findings
- 0 points: Fails to properly integrate experimental validation results

## âœ… **PASS CRITERIA**
**PASS (100 points ONLY)**: Perfect balanced integration pipeline
**FAIL (<100 points)**: Any integration failures, balance issues, or poor performance

## ðŸ“‹ **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**
- [ ] Complete end-to-end pipeline working from academic text to balanced schema
- [ ] Balanced processing maintained at every pipeline stage
- [ ] High performance with acceptable processing times
- [ ] Comprehensive quality assurance throughout
- [ ] Integration with experimental validation components
- [ ] Pipeline balance report demonstrates equal treatment
- [ ] Production-ready implementation with robust error handling
