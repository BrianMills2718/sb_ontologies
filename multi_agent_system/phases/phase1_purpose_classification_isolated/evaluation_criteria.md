# Evaluation Criteria: Purpose Classification System

**Success Threshold**: Must achieve exactly 100/100 points to PASS

## ðŸ“Š **EVALUATION CRITERIA**

### **1. Balanced Purpose Detection (25 points)**
**Test the classifier across all five purposes:**
```bash
cd /home/brian/lit_review/evidence/phase1_purpose_classification
python working_implementation.py
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: Equal sophistication demonstrated across descriptive, explanatory, predictive, causal, and intervention purposes
- 0 points: Any purpose over-emphasized or under-represented

### **2. No Causal Over-Emphasis (25 points)**
**Verify balanced treatment:**
```bash
python test_purpose_classification.py --test-balance
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: Causal analysis treated equally with other purposes, no over-emphasis detected
- 0 points: Any evidence of causal bias or over-emphasis

### **3. Comprehensive Test Coverage (25 points)**
**Run full test suite:**
```bash
python -m pytest /home/brian/lit_review/evidence/phase1_purpose_classification/ -v
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: All tests pass, comprehensive coverage of all purpose types
- 0 points: Any test failures or incomplete coverage

### **4. Multi-Purpose Theory Handling (25 points)**
**Test complex theories serving multiple purposes:**
```bash
python test_purpose_classification.py --test-multi-purpose
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: Accurately handles theories with multiple purposes
- 0 points: Fails to properly classify multi-purpose theories

## âœ… **PASS CRITERIA**
**PASS (100 points ONLY)**: Perfect balanced purpose classification system
**FAIL (<100 points)**: Any imbalance, causal over-emphasis, or deficiencies

## ðŸ“‹ **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**
- [ ] All five purposes (descriptive/explanatory/predictive/causal/intervention) treated with equal sophistication
- [ ] No causal over-emphasis detected in classification logic
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage across all purpose types
- [ ] Multi-purpose theories handled correctly
- [ ] Balance validation report demonstrates equal treatment
- [ ] Production-ready implementation with clean code
