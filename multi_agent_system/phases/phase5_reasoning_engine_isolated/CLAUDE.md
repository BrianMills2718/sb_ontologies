# Phase 5: Cross-Purpose Reasoning Engine

**Implementation Agent Instructions - Completely Isolated**

You are implementing a reasoning engine that enables sophisticated analysis across all five theoretical purposes with cross-purpose integration capabilities and balanced analytical sophistication.

## ðŸŽ¯ **GOAL**
Create a reasoning engine that performs analysis across descriptive, explanatory, predictive, causal, and intervention purposes with cross-purpose integration and equal analytical depth.

## ðŸ“‹ **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **1. Create Multi-Purpose Reasoning Engine**
Location: `/home/brian/lit_review/evidence/phase5_reasoning_engine/reasoning_engine.py`

```python
class CrossPurposeReasoningEngine:
    """Advanced reasoning across all theoretical purposes with integration"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize reasoning capabilities for all purposes"""
        pass
    
    def analyze_multi_purpose(self, schema: dict, query: str) -> dict:
        """
        Analyze across all purposes with cross-purpose integration
        Returns: {
            'descriptive_analysis': dict,
            'explanatory_analysis': dict,
            'predictive_analysis': dict,
            'causal_analysis': dict,
            'intervention_analysis': dict,
            'cross_purpose_insights': dict,
            'integrated_reasoning': dict
        }
        """
        pass
    
    def reason_descriptive(self, schema: dict, query: str) -> dict:
        """Taxonomic, typological, classification reasoning"""
        pass
    
    def reason_explanatory(self, schema: dict, query: str) -> dict:
        """Mechanism, process, structural reasoning"""
        pass
    
    def reason_predictive(self, schema: dict, query: str) -> dict:
        """Forecasting, modeling, prediction reasoning"""
        pass
    
    def reason_causal(self, schema: dict, query: str) -> dict:
        """Causal pathway, intervention reasoning"""
        pass
    
    def reason_intervention(self, schema: dict, query: str) -> dict:
        """Action, implementation, strategy reasoning"""
        pass
    
    def integrate_cross_purpose_insights(self, analyses: dict) -> dict:
        """Integrate insights across multiple purposes"""
        pass
    
    def validate_reasoning_balance(self, results: dict) -> dict:
        """Ensure equal analytical depth across all purposes"""
        pass
```

### **2. Create Purpose-Specific Reasoning Modules**
Location: `/home/brian/lit_review/evidence/phase5_reasoning_engine/purpose_reasoning/`

Implement sophisticated reasoning for each purpose type.

### **3. Create Cross-Purpose Integration Framework**
Location: `/home/brian/lit_review/evidence/phase5_reasoning_engine/cross_purpose_integration.py`

Enable sophisticated reasoning that spans multiple theoretical purposes.

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING REQUIREMENTS**
- Test 1: Descriptive reasoning capabilities (taxonomies, classifications)
- Test 2: Explanatory reasoning capabilities (mechanisms, processes)
- Test 3: Predictive reasoning capabilities (forecasting, modeling)
- Test 4: Causal reasoning capabilities (pathways, interventions)
- Test 5: Intervention reasoning capabilities (actions, strategies)
- Test 6: Cross-purpose integration reasoning
- Test 7: Complex multi-purpose query handling
- Test 8: Reasoning balance validation (equal analytical depth)
- Test 9: Performance testing with real theoretical schemas

## ðŸ“¦ **DELIVERABLES**
Create evidence package at: `/home/brian/lit_review/evidence/phase5_reasoning_engine/`

### **Required Files**:
**CRITICAL**: You MUST create ALL of these files or evaluation will FAIL

1. **implementation_summary.md** - Technical overview of cross-purpose reasoning
2. **test_results.txt** - All test outputs showing balanced reasoning capabilities
3. **working_implementation.py** - Standalone reasoning demonstration
4. **reasoning_engine.py** - Main reasoning engine implementation
5. **purpose_reasoning/** - Purpose-specific reasoning modules
6. **cross_purpose_integration.py** - Cross-purpose integration framework
7. **test_reasoning_engine.py** - Comprehensive test suite
8. **reasoning_balance_report.md** - Evidence of equal analytical depth
9. **query_examples.py** - Example queries demonstrating capabilities
10. **performance_analysis.md** - Reasoning performance analysis

## âœ… **SUCCESS CRITERIA (100/100 REQUIRED)**
1. **Equal Reasoning Sophistication**: All five purposes supported with equal analytical depth
2. **Cross-Purpose Integration**: Sophisticated reasoning across multiple purposes
3. **Advanced Capabilities**: Complex query handling with high-quality insights
4. **Performance Excellence**: Efficient reasoning with acceptable response times
5. **Production Ready**: Robust, scalable, extensible implementation

**CRITICAL BALANCE REQUIREMENT**: The reasoning engine must demonstrate equal analytical sophistication for descriptive, explanatory, predictive, causal, and intervention reasoning. Any analytical imbalance will result in FAILURE.
