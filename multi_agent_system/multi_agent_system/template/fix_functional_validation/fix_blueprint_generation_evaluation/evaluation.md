# Phase fix_blueprint_generation: Fix blueprint generation to create all required endpoints properly - Evaluation

## Evaluation Task
Assess whether Phase fix_blueprint_generation was completed successfully by examining evidence.

## Files to Check
Examine these files in ./evidence/:
- `blueprint_fixes.txt` - Specific code changes made to blueprint generation
- `endpoint_verification.txt` - Test results showing endpoints now work
- `production_validation_results.txt` - New production validation results
- `fix_blueprint_generation_summary.txt` - Summary of what was accomplished

## Pass Requirements (ALL must be met)
1. **Blueprint Fixes Made**: Specific code changes documented showing what was fixed
2. **Endpoints Now Work**: Evidence shows previously broken endpoints now return 200 (not 404)
3. **Production Validation Improved**: New validation results show improvement from 50% functional success
4. **Verification Complete**: Testing evidence proves fixes work
5. **Summary Accurate**: Summary correctly describes what was fixed and how

## Fail Conditions (ANY causes failure)
- No specific code changes documented
- Endpoints still return 404 errors
- Production validation results unchanged or worse
- No verification testing performed
- Summary missing or inaccurate about fixes made

## Evaluation Process
1. Check each required evidence file exists
2. Verify content quality and completeness
3. Assess implementation against requirements
4. Validate verification claims
5. Score objectively based only on evidence

## Output Format
Provide result in exactly this format:

```
RESULT: PASS
SCORE: [0-100]
ISSUES: [list any issues found, or "None"]
SUMMARY: [brief description of what was accomplished]
```

OR

```
RESULT: FAIL  
SCORE: [0-100]
ISSUES: [list specific failures]
SUMMARY: [brief description of what was attempted]
```

## Scoring Guidelines
- **90-100**: Excellent, exceeds requirements
- **70-89**: Good, meets all requirements (minimum for PASS)
- **50-69**: Acceptable, minor issues (FAIL)
- **30-49**: Poor, major issues (FAIL)
- **0-29**: Failed, requirements not met (FAIL)

## Isolation Requirements
- Base assessment ONLY on evidence provided
- Do NOT access implementation directories
- Do NOT reference implementation process
- Evaluate objectively and independently
