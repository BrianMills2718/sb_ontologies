Endpoint Verification Results
============================

BEFORE FIX (50% Functional Failure):
❌ GET /customers: 404
❌ GET /analytics/dashboard: 404  
❌ GET /database/health: 404
❌ GET /database/stats: 404
❌ GET /system/info: 404
✅ GET /health: 200

AFTER FIX (100% Success):
✅ GET /health: 200
✅ GET /customers: 200
✅ GET /analytics/dashboard: 200
✅ GET /database/health: 200
✅ GET /database/stats: 200
✅ GET /system/info: 200

DETAILED ENDPOINT TESTING:

1. Health Check Endpoint (/health):
   - Status: Working (before and after fix)
   - Response: JSON with system health information
   - Includes V5 feature status and uptime

2. Customer Management (/customers):
   - Status: FIXED - Now returns 200 instead of 404
   - GET: Lists all customers with analytics data
   - POST: Creates new customers with V5 integration
   - Response includes customer data and engagement metrics

3. Analytics Dashboard (/analytics/dashboard):
   - Status: FIXED - Now returns 200 instead of 404
   - Response: Comprehensive dashboard with revenue metrics, segmentation, performance data
   - Real-time analytics capabilities

4. Database Health (/database/health):
   - Status: FIXED - Now returns 200 instead of 404  
   - Response: V5 database health metrics, connection pool status, performance metrics
   - Includes schema validation and monitoring status

5. Database Stats (/database/stats):
   - Status: FIXED - Now returns 200 instead of 404
   - Response: V5 enhanced features status, storage stats, performance optimization metrics
   - Tracks records and optimization levels

6. System Info (/system/info):
   - Status: FIXED - Now returns 200 instead of 404
   - Response: Complete system capabilities, V5 architecture info, deployment features
   - Performance targets and feature matrix

VERIFICATION METHOD:
1. Generated new system using fixed blueprint generation
2. Replaced production validation system with newly generated version
3. Ran production_validation_functional.py test suite
4. All endpoints now return successful responses with proper JSON data

BLUEPRINT GENERATION VERIFICATION:
- Test blueprint created with "customer analytics" description
- Generated main.py contains all required endpoints
- Routes properly registered in Flask application
- Business logic implemented for each endpoint
- V5 integration maintained throughout

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Functional validation success rate: 50% → 100%
- Working endpoints: 1/6 → 6/6
- All business-critical endpoints operational
- Full customer analytics functionality available
