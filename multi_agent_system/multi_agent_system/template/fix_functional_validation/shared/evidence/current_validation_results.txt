PROBLEM: Generated system has broken/missing endpoints.
Expected endpoints that should work but return 404:
- /customers (should return customer data)
- /analytics/dashboard (should return dashboard HTML)
- /database/health (should return V5 database health)
- /database/stats (should return V5 database stats)
- /system/info (should return system information)

Only /health endpoint works properly.
