# Phase fix_v5_integration: Fix V5 database integration endpoint issues - Evaluation

## Evaluation Task
Assess whether Phase fix_v5_integration was completed successfully by examining evidence.

## Files to Check
Examine these files in ./evidence/:
- `fix_v5_integration_output.txt` - Primary deliverable
- `fix_v5_integration_summary.txt` - Implementation summary  
- `fix_v5_integration_verification.txt` - Verification proof

## Pass Requirements (ALL must be met)
<!-- Customize these requirements for your specific phase -->
1. **Files Exist**: All required evidence files exist and are readable
2. **Content Quality**: Files contain substantive, accurate content
3. **Requirements Met**: Implementation meets specified requirements
4. **Verification Provided**: Evidence demonstrates implementation works
5. **Summary Accurate**: Summary correctly describes accomplishments

## Fail Conditions (ANY causes failure)
<!-- Customize these conditions for your specific phase -->
- Required files missing or empty
- Content is placeholder text or incomplete
- Implementation doesn't meet requirements
- No verification provided
- Summary is inaccurate or missing

## Evaluation Process
1. Check each required evidence file exists
2. Verify content quality and completeness
3. Assess implementation against requirements
4. Validate verification claims
5. Score objectively based only on evidence

## Output Format
Provide result in exactly this format:

```
RESULT: PASS
SCORE: [0-100]
ISSUES: [list any issues found, or "None"]
SUMMARY: [brief description of what was accomplished]
```

OR

```
RESULT: FAIL  
SCORE: [0-100]
ISSUES: [list specific failures]
SUMMARY: [brief description of what was attempted]
```

## Scoring Guidelines
- **90-100**: Excellent, exceeds requirements
- **70-89**: Good, meets all requirements (minimum for PASS)
- **50-69**: Acceptable, minor issues (FAIL)
- **30-49**: Poor, major issues (FAIL)
- **0-29**: Failed, requirements not met (FAIL)

## Isolation Requirements
- Base assessment ONLY on evidence provided
- Do NOT access implementation directories
- Do NOT reference implementation process
- Evaluate objectively and independently
