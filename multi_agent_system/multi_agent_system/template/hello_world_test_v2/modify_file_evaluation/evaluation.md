# Phase modify_file: Modify the file to add additional content - Evaluation

## Evaluation Task
Assess whether Phase modify_file was completed successfully by examining evidence.

## Files to Check
Examine these files in ./evidence/:
- `hello.txt` - The modified file (should contain both original and new content)
- `modify_file_summary.txt` - Implementation summary  
- `modify_file_verification.txt` - Verification proof

## Pass Requirements (ALL must be met)
1. **Modified File Exists**: `hello.txt` exists and is readable
2. **Content Preserved**: Original "Hello World!" text is still present
3. **Content Added**: New line "Welcome to the multi-agent test!" is present
4. **Proper Formatting**: File has proper line breaks between content
5. **Evidence Complete**: Summary and verification files exist and are accurate

## Fail Conditions (ANY causes failure)
- `hello.txt` file missing or empty
- Original "Hello World!" content missing or changed
- New "Welcome to the multi-agent test!" content missing
- Improper formatting or line breaks
- Summary file missing or inaccurate
- Verification file missing or incomplete

## Evaluation Process
1. Check each required evidence file exists
2. Verify content quality and completeness
3. Assess implementation against requirements
4. Validate verification claims
5. Score objectively based only on evidence

## Output Format
Provide result in exactly this format:

```
RESULT: PASS
SCORE: [0-100]
ISSUES: [list any issues found, or "None"]
SUMMARY: [brief description of what was accomplished]
```

OR

```
RESULT: FAIL  
SCORE: [0-100]
ISSUES: [list specific failures]
SUMMARY: [brief description of what was attempted]
```

## Scoring Guidelines
- **90-100**: Excellent, exceeds requirements
- **70-89**: Good, meets all requirements (minimum for PASS)
- **50-69**: Acceptable, minor issues (FAIL)
- **30-49**: Poor, major issues (FAIL)
- **0-29**: Failed, requirements not met (FAIL)

## Isolation Requirements
- Base assessment ONLY on evidence provided
- Do NOT access implementation directories
- Do NOT reference implementation process
- Evaluate objectively and independently
