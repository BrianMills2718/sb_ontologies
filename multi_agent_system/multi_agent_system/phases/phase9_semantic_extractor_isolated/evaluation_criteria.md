# Evaluation Criteria: Semantic Extractor Implementation

**External Evaluator Instructions - No Implementation Context**

You are evaluating a semantic extractor implementation. You have NO knowledge of how it was built or what challenges were faced. Evaluate only based on the evidence provided.

## 🎯 **EVALUATION OVERVIEW**

**System Being Evaluated**: Semantic extractor that extracts user intent from natural language requests for system generation.

**Success Threshold**: Must achieve 100/100 points to PASS

## 📊 **EVALUATION CRITERIA**

### **1. Functional Correctness (25 points)**

**Test the semantic extractor by running it yourself:**

```bash
# Run the extraction demo
cd /home/brian/autocoder3_cc
python demo_semantic_extraction.py
```

**Scoring**:
- 25 points: Extracts correct intent from all test cases
- 20 points: Extracts correct intent from 80%+ test cases  
- 15 points: Extracts correct intent from 60%+ test cases
- 10 points: Basic functionality works but frequent errors
- 0 points: Doesn't work or crashes

**Verify**:
- System name is valid Python identifier
- API operations are logical for the request
- Database/UI needs are correctly identified
- Data types are relevant to the domain

### **2. Reliability & Error Handling (20 points)**

**Test edge cases:**
```bash
# Test with malformed input
python -c "
from blueprint_language.semantic_extractor import SemanticExtractor
extractor = SemanticExtractor()
# Test empty string
result = extractor.extract_intent('')
print('Empty string:', result)
# Test very long string
result = extractor.extract_intent('a' * 10000)
print('Long string handled')
# Test nonsensical request
result = extractor.extract_intent('purple monkey dishwasher')
print('Nonsense handled')
"
```

**Scoring**:
- 20 points: Handles all edge cases gracefully with meaningful responses
- 15 points: Handles most edge cases, minor issues only
- 10 points: Basic error handling, some crashes on edge cases
- 5 points: Poor error handling, frequent failures
- 0 points: Crashes on edge cases

### **3. Performance (15 points)**

**Measure response time and token usage:**
```bash
# Run performance tests
python tests/test_semantic_extraction.py --performance
```

**Scoring**:
- 15 points: <2 seconds response time, efficient token usage
- 12 points: 2-5 seconds response time, reasonable token usage
- 8 points: 5-10 seconds response time
- 4 points: 10-30 seconds response time
- 0 points: >30 seconds or excessive token usage

### **4. Test Coverage (15 points)**

**Run the test suite:**
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/test_semantic_extraction.py -v
```

**Scoring**:
- 15 points: All tests pass, comprehensive coverage of functionality
- 12 points: 90%+ tests pass, good coverage
- 8 points: 70%+ tests pass, adequate coverage
- 4 points: 50%+ tests pass, limited coverage
- 0 points: <50% tests pass or no meaningful tests

### **5. Code Quality (15 points)**

**Review the implementation:**
- Check `blueprint_language/semantic_extractor.py`
- Check `blueprint_language/intent_validator.py`

**Scoring**:
- 15 points: Clean, well-documented, follows best practices
- 12 points: Good code quality, minor style issues
- 8 points: Functional but could be cleaner
- 4 points: Messy but works
- 0 points: Poor code quality or doesn't follow requirements

### **6. Demonstration Quality (10 points)**

**Run the demo and verify claims:**
```bash
python demo_semantic_extraction.py
```

**Scoring**:
- 10 points: Clear demonstration of improvement over current approach
- 8 points: Good demonstration with minor issues
- 6 points: Adequate demonstration
- 4 points: Weak demonstration
- 0 points: No meaningful demonstration or claims not supported

## 📝 **EVALUATION PROCESS**

### **Step 1: Setup**
1. Navigate to evidence directory
2. Verify all required files are present
3. Check that code can be executed

### **Step 2: Functional Testing**
1. Run the demo script
2. Test the semantic extractor directly
3. Verify outputs match expected intent extraction

### **Step 3: Reliability Testing**
1. Test edge cases and error conditions
2. Verify graceful handling of malformed input
3. Check logging and error messages

### **Step 4: Performance Testing**
1. Measure response times
2. Check token usage efficiency
3. Test with various request sizes

### **Step 5: Code Review**
1. Review implementation code
2. Check documentation quality
3. Verify adherence to requirements

## ✅ **PASS CRITERIA**

**PASS (100 points ONLY)**: 
- Semantic extractor works reliably with 100% accuracy
- Handles all edge cases perfectly
- Performance meets all requirements
- Code quality is excellent
- Demonstration proves all claims

**FAIL (<100 points)**:
- Critical functionality missing or broken
- Poor error handling
- Unacceptable performance
- Poor code quality
- Cannot verify claims
