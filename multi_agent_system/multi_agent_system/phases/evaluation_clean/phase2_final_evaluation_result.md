- ✅ `/implementation_summary.md` - Comprehensive implementation documentation

**File Structure Compliance**: All files correctly located at evidence root directory, addressing Round 2 feedback.

### Core Functionality Verification ✅

#### 1. Component Registry - PASS
- **Registration System**: Successfully registers component types (Source, Transformer, Sink)
- **Type Validation**: Enforces strict component type requirements with fail-hard behavior
- **Instance Management**: Creates and manages component instances with proper validation
- **Logic Validation**: 
  - Sources: Must have outputs, cannot have inputs ✅
  - Transformers: Must have both inputs and outputs ✅
  - Sinks: Must have inputs, cannot have outputs ✅

**Evidence**: Live test execution shows component creation working correctly:
```
✅ Created and registered component: test_source_eb465506 (Source)
✅ Dependencies validated for component: valid_source_0ace2d1c
```

#### 2. Schema Framework - PASS
- **Schema Hierarchy**: Complete Pydantic-based schema system implemented
- **Built-in Schemas**: ComponentData → SourceData/TransformerData/SinkData inheritance working
- **Validation Engine**: Strict data validation with fail-hard behavior
- **Compatibility Checking**: Schema compatibility validation functional

**Evidence**: Schema validation working correctly:
```
✅ All component schemas validated: 2 schemas
✅ Schema compatibility validation test passed
```

#### 3. Component Lifecycle - PASS
- **State Management**: Complete lifecycle tracking (UNINITIALIZED → ACTIVE → DESTROYED)
- **Dependency Management**: Enforces dependency order for creation and teardown
- **Validation Phases**: Multi-phase validation (pre-creation, initialization, post-creation, activation)
- **Proper Cleanup**: Dependency-aware teardown prevents orphaned components

**Evidence**: Lifecycle management working correctly:
```
✅ Component created successfully: lifecycle_test_source (0.000s)
✅ Lifecycle validation passed for: validation_test_transformer (0.000s)
```

#### 4. Security Validation - PASS
- **Multi-layer Analysis**: Code, configuration, dependencies, runtime security checks
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, insecure defaults
- **Policy Enforcement**: Fails hard on critical security issues
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 28 different security checks per component

**Evidence**: Security validation working correctly:
```
✅ Security validation completed for secure_source_7687c74d: 27/28 checks passed
❌ Security validation failed for critical_source: Component 'critical_source' has CRITICAL security issues
```

### Integration Testing Results ✅

**Test Execution Summary**:
- **Tests Run**: 18
- **Passed**: 18  
- **Failed**: 0
- **Success Rate**: 100%

**Test Categories Covered**:
1. Component Registry Integration (2 tests) - PASS
2. Schema Validation Integration (3 tests) - PASS  
3. Component Lifecycle Integration (4 tests) - PASS
4. Security Validation Integration (3 tests) - PASS
5. Full System Integration (3 tests) - PASS
6. Phase 2 Compliance Validation (3 tests) - PASS

**Critical Integration Points Verified**:
- Components work together seamlessly ✅
- End-to-end workflow from creation to teardown ✅
- Schema compatibility between component connections ✅
- Security validation enforced across all components ✅

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT ✅

### Fail-Hard Validation Verified
- **NO mock modes found**: All validation is real and enforced
- **NO fallback mechanisms**: System fails immediately on validation errors
- **NO graceful degradation**: Components must meet all requirements

**Evidence of Fail-Hard Behavior**:
```python
# Component Registry fails hard on unknown types
ComponentRegistryError: Unknown component type 'UnknownType'

# Schema Validator fails hard on invalid data  
SchemaValidationError: Schema validation failed for 'SourceData'

# Security Validator fails hard on critical issues
SecurityValidationError: Component has CRITICAL security issues
```

### Security Vulnerability Detection
- **Pattern Matching**: Detects SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets
- **AST Analysis**: Deep code analysis for dangerous function calls
- **Configuration Security**: Validates secure defaults and configurations
- **Policy Enforcement**: Configurable security thresholds with strict enforcement

### No Security Bypasses
- All components must pass security validation to be created
- Critical security issues prevent component instantiation
- No development/debug modes that bypass security

## ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE ✅

### V5.0 Principles Verified
- **Fail-Hard Validation**: ✅ Verified throughout implementation
- **Security-First Design**: ✅ All components must pass security validation  
- **Schema-Driven Architecture**: ✅ Pydantic schemas with strict typing
- **Complete Lifecycle Management**: ✅ Full state tracking and dependency management

### Phase 2 Requirements Met
1. ✅ **Enhanced Component Registry**: Implemented with type validation
2. ✅ **Schema-Aware Validation**: Pydantic-based framework complete
3. ✅ **Component Lifecycle Management**: Complete state tracking system
4. ✅ **Security Validation**: Comprehensive security framework
5. ✅ **Integration Testing**: All components tested together
6. ✅ **NO Mock/Fallback**: Verified absence of any fallback mechanisms

## ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### None Critical
No critical issues found that prevent approval. All major functionality working correctly.

### Round 3 Improvements Verified
Based on test results, all previous round issues have been resolved:
- ✅ File structure corrected
- ✅ Component naming conflicts resolved  
- ✅ Test isolation improved
- ✅ Security policy enforcement fixed
