# Phase 4: ValidationDrivenOrchestrator - External Evaluation Criteria

**CONTEXT**: You are an external evaluator with ZERO knowledge of implementation details. Evaluate evidence packages objectively against stated criteria.

## Phase 4: ValidationDrivenOrchestrator

### Required Evidence Files (13 files)
- [ ] `validation_driven_orchestrator.py` - Core orchestrator system
- [ ] `dependency_checker.py` - Pre-flight dependency validation
- [ ] `validation_result_types.py` - Result type definitions
- [ ] `level1_framework_integration.py` - Level 1 framework validation
- [ ] `level2_component_integration.py` - Level 2 component logic + AST healing
- [ ] `level3_system_integration.py` - Level 3 system integration + config regen
- [ ] `level4_semantic_integration.py` - Level 4 semantic validation + healing
- [ ] `phase2_integration.py` - Phase 2 component library integration
- [ ] `phase3_integration.py` - Phase 3 blueprint schema integration
- [ ] `healing_orchestration.py` - Coordinated healing systems
- [ ] `integration_tests.py` - Complete integration test suite
- [ ] `test_results.txt` - All test execution results
- [ ] `implementation_summary.md` - Complete implementation documentation

### Success Criteria Validation

1. **ValidationDrivenOrchestrator Core**: Central orchestration with four-tier validation hierarchy
2. **Pre-flight Dependency Validation**: Fail-hard dependency checking before validation begins
3. **AST Healing Integration**: Level 2 component logic healing integration
4. **Configuration Regeneration**: Level 3 integration failure handling (safer than modification)
5. **Semantic Healing Integration**: Level 4 semantic validation with LLM healing
6. **Phase 2 Component Integration**: Integration with enhanced component library
7. **Phase 3 Blueprint Integration**: Integration with V5.0 blueprint schema system
8. **Complete Integration Tests**: All validation levels working together
9. **Performance Validation**: Production-ready performance characteristics

### Evaluation Questions

**Core Orchestration:**
- Does ValidationDrivenOrchestrator properly orchestrate all four validation levels?
- Are validation levels executed in sequence (Level 1→2→3→4)?
- Does pre-flight dependency checking fail hard when dependencies are missing?

**Healing Integration:**
- Does Level 2 integrate with AST healing for component logic failures?
- Does Level 3 use configuration regeneration (not modification) for integration failures?
- Does Level 4 integrate with semantic healing for semantic validation failures?

**Phase Integration:**
- Does the system integrate with completed Phase 2 component library?
- Does the system integrate with completed Phase 3 blueprint schema?
- Can you trace integration points in the code?

**Testing and Performance:**
- Do integration tests demonstrate all four validation levels working?
- Are test results documented with pass/fail rates?
- Does performance meet production requirements?

**Security and Fail-Hard:**
- Are there any mock modes or fallback mechanisms?
- Does the system fail hard when validation fails?
- Is dependency checking rigorous and uncompromising?

### External Evaluator Checklist

An external evaluator must verify:
- [ ] ValidationDrivenOrchestrator successfully orchestrates all four validation levels
- [ ] Pre-flight dependency checking fails hard when dependencies are missing
- [ ] Level 1 framework validation executes and fails hard on framework issues
- [ ] Level 2 component validation integrates with AST healing
- [ ] Level 3 integration validation uses configuration regeneration
- [ ] Level 4 semantic validation integrates with semantic healing
- [ ] Phase 2 component library integration works seamlessly
- [ ] Phase 3 blueprint schema integration works seamlessly
- [ ] Blueprint parsing supports V5.0 schema requirements
- [ ] End-to-end system generation pipeline is complete and functional
- [ ] Performance meets requirements for production use
- [ ] All validation levels maintain fail-hard principles

### Evaluation Result Format

```
PHASE 4: [PASS/FAIL]
Evidence Quality: [EXCEPTIONAL/ADEQUATE/INSUFFICIENT/FAILED]

FINDINGS:
- [Specific evidence that supports determination]
- [Integration verification results]
- [Performance assessment results]

SECURITY ASSESSMENT:
- [Security validation results]
- [Any fallback mechanisms found]

INTEGRATION VERIFICATION:
- [Phase 2 integration status]
- [Phase 3 integration status]
- [Four-tier validation orchestration status]

RECOMMENDATION: [Proceed to next phase / Return for fixes]
```

**CRITICAL**: Base evaluation ONLY on evidence provided. Verify actual integration with Phase 2 and Phase 3 systems. Be rigorous about fail-hard requirements.
