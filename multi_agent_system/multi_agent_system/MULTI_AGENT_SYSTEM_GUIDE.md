# Multi-Agent V5.2 Implementation System: Complete Guide

**Purpose**: Definitive guide for maintaining the proven multi-agent approach that achieved 100% success rates across Phases 2-7.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### **Zero Context Contamination**
- Implementation agents receive ONLY their phase instructions
- Evaluation agents receive ONLY evidence + criteria
- No agent knows about previous attempts, other phases, or implementation history

### **Fail-Hard Validation** 
- 100% pass rate required to proceed
- No mocks, no fallbacks, no "partial success"
- Raw evidence execution must prove functionality

### **Evidence-Based Success**
- External evaluators can verify all claims by executing code
- Working demonstrations with terminal output logs
- Deployable systems that external parties can test

## 📁 Documentation Structure

### **1. Long-Term Planning Documents** (`/docs/`)
```
docs/
├── V5.2_architecture_spec.md        # Overall V5.2 architecture and vision
├── MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md      # This document - how the system works
├── current_phase_status.md          # Single source of truth for current phase
└── completed_phases_summary.md      # Archive of completed phases
```

**Purpose**: 
- High-level planning and architecture
- Cross-phase coordination
- Historical record of what's been accomplished

### **2. Isolated Phase Instructions** (`/phases/`)
```
phases/
├── README.md                        # How to use the multi-agent system
├── phase{N}_isolated/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md                    # Complete isolated instructions for phase N
│   └── evaluation_criteria.md      # Evaluation criteria for phase N
└── evaluation_clean/
    ├── current_evidence/            # Copy evidence here for evaluation
    ├── evaluation_criteria.md      # Current evaluation criteria
    └── phase{N}_evaluation_result.md # Evaluation results
```

**Purpose**:
- Self-contained phase implementations
- Zero context leakage between phases
- Clean evaluation environment

### **3. Root Project Instructions** (`/CLAUDE.md`)
```
CLAUDE.md                            # Current phase instructions for main conversation
```

**Purpose**:
- Instructions for the main conversation agent
- Should point to current phase or coordination tasks
- Updated after each phase completion

## 🔄 Multi-Agent Workflow

### **Phase Implementation Cycle**

#### **Step 1: Prepare Phase Instructions**
```bash
# Create isolated phase directory
mkdir -p phases/phase{N}_isolated

# Create complete implementation instructions
phases/phase{N}_isolated/CLAUDE.md

# Create evaluation criteria
phases/phase{N}_isolated/evaluation_criteria.md
```

**CLAUDE.md Requirements**:
- Complete implementation instructions (no external references)
- Exact evidence structure specification
- All required file locations and naming
- Success criteria and deliverables
- No references to other phases or conversation history

#### **Step 2: Launch Implementation Agent**
```
Task: "You are an implementation agent for Phase {N}. Read the implementation instructions in /home/brian/autocoder3_cc/phases/phase{N}_isolated/CLAUDE.md and implement the complete Phase {N} system according to those specifications. You have NO context from previous implementations and should work only from the instructions provided."
```

**Critical Rules**:
- Agent receives ONLY the phase directory
- No conversation history or context
- Must create complete evidence package
- All evidence saved to location specified in CLAUDE.md

#### **Step 3: Copy Evidence for Evaluation**
```bash
# Clean evaluation directory
rm -rf phases/evaluation_clean/current_evidence/*

# Copy phase evidence for evaluation
cp -r evidence/phase{N}_*/* phases/evaluation_clean/current_evidence/

# Copy evaluation criteria
cp phases/phase{N}_isolated/evaluation_criteria.md phases/evaluation_clean/
```

#### **Step 4: Launch Evaluation Agent**
```
Task: "You are an external evaluator for Phase {N}. You have NO knowledge of the implementation process. Read the evaluation criteria in /home/brian/autocoder3_cc/phases/evaluation_clean/evaluation_criteria.md and evaluate the evidence in /home/brian/autocoder3_cc/phases/evaluation_clean/current_evidence/. Execute all provided code, run tests, and verify against criteria. Write your evaluation result to /home/brian/autocoder3_cc/phases/evaluation_clean/phase{N}_evaluation_result.md."
```

**Critical Rules**:
- Agent receives ONLY evidence + criteria
- Must execute all code to verify claims
- No implementation context or history
- Must provide objective PASS/FAIL with specific evidence

#### **Step 5: Process Results**
```bash
# Read evaluation result
cat phases/evaluation_clean/phase{N}_evaluation_result.md
```

**If PASS**:
- Update `/docs/current_phase_status.md`
- Archive phase in `/docs/completed_phases_summary.md`
- Move to next phase

**If FAIL**:
- Launch remediation agent with evaluation feedback
- Repeat until PASS achieved
- Never proceed with partial success

### **Remediation Cycle**
```
Task: "You are a remediation agent for Phase {N}. The external evaluation found specific failures: [paste evaluation results]. Fix these specific issues in the evidence located at /home/brian/autocoder3_cc/evidence/phase{N}_*/. Address only the failed criteria and re-test until all issues are resolved."
```

## 📊 Documentation Maintenance Protocol

### **Documentation Archival Strategy**
Keep current workspace clean while preserving historical record:

```
/docs/                              # Current active documentation
├── current_phase_status.md         # Single source of truth
├── MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md     # This guide
└── V5_architecture_spec.md         # Overall architecture

/archive/                           # Historical preservation
├── todo_nextsteps/                 # Outdated plans and roadmaps
├── claude_md_archive/              # Historical CLAUDE.md files  
├── documentation/                  # Old documentation versions
└── [timestamp_folders]/            # Dated archives
```

**Archival Rules**:
- Move outdated plans to `/archive/todo_nextsteps/` with timestamp
- Archive old CLAUDE.md files to `/archive/claude_md_archive/` with timestamp
- Keep current workspace focused on active work only
- Preserve complete history for reference and lessons learned

### **Git Commit Protocol After Each Phase**
**CRITICAL**: Commit after each successful phase to preserve progress

```bash
# After external evaluation confirms PASS
git add .
git commit -m "feat: PHASE {N} COMPLETE - {Phase Name} PASS ✅

• {Key achievement 1}
• {Key achievement 2}  
• {Key achievement 3}
• External evaluation: {Score}/100 PASS
• Evidence location: evidence/phase{N}_{description}/
• {Performance metrics or notable outcomes}

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push to preserve progress
git push origin main
```

**Commit Message Standards**:
- Use consistent format for easy tracking
- Include external evaluation score
- Mention evidence location
- List key achievements  
- Note any performance metrics
- Reference multi-agent process success

### **Current Phase Tracking**
**File**: `/docs/current_phase_status.md`
```markdown
# Current Phase Status

**Active Phase**: Phase {N} - {Phase Name}
**Status**: Implementation / Evaluation / Remediation
**Evidence Location**: `evidence/phase{N}_*/`
**External Evaluation**: PASS / FAIL / PENDING

## Completed Phases
- ✅ Phase 2: Enhanced Component Library - PASS
- ✅ Phase 3: Blueprint Schema V5 - PASS  
- ✅ Phase 4: ValidationDrivenOrchestrator - PASS
- ✅ Phase 6: SystemExecutionHarness - PASS
- ✅ Phase 7: Two-Phase Generation Pipeline - PASS

## Current Phase Details
**Phase {N} Objectives**: [Brief summary]
**Key Deliverables**: [List]
**Success Criteria**: [Link to evaluation criteria]
```

### **Root CLAUDE.md Maintenance**
**Update Pattern**: Root CLAUDE.md should contain:

**During Phase Implementation**:
```markdown
# Current Phase: Phase {N} - {Phase Name}

**STATUS**: Phase {N} implementation in progress using multi-agent approach

**CRITICAL**: This conversation is coordinating the multi-agent implementation process.

[Current phase coordination instructions]
```

**Between Phases**:
```markdown
# Phase Coordination Mode

**STATUS**: All phases complete, planning next steps

[Next steps planning or architectural discussions]
```

### **Evidence Organization**
```
evidence/
├── phase2_component_library/         # Phase 2 evidence (complete)
├── phase3_blueprint_schema_v5/       # Phase 3 evidence (complete)
├── phase4_validation_orchestrator/   # Phase 4 evidence (complete)
├── phase6_harness/                   # Phase 6 evidence (complete)
├── phase7_generation/                # Phase 7 evidence (complete)
└── phase{N}_{description}/           # Current phase evidence
```

**Evidence Naming Convention**:
- `phase{N}_{descriptive_name}/`
- Always include phase number for clear ordering
- Use descriptive names that match phase objectives

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **1. Context Leakage**
❌ **Wrong**: "Based on our previous conversation..."
✅ **Right**: "Read the instructions in {specific file path}"

### **2. Partial Success**
❌ **Wrong**: "80% of tests pass, good enough to proceed"
✅ **Right**: "100% pass rate required, fix all failures"

### **3. Documentation Drift**
❌ **Wrong**: Multiple status documents with conflicting information
✅ **Right**: Single source of truth updated systematically

### **4. Evidence Contamination**
❌ **Wrong**: Evaluator has access to implementation conversation
✅ **Right**: Evaluator only sees evidence + criteria

### **5. Rushing Evaluation**
❌ **Wrong**: "Tests look good, probably works"
✅ **Right**: Execute all code, verify all claims, test edge cases

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### **Phase Success Indicators**
- ✅ External evaluator achieves 100% pass rate
- ✅ All code executes without errors
- ✅ Working demonstrations deployable by external parties
- ✅ Raw evidence logs prove functionality
- ✅ No mocks, fallbacks, or placeholder implementations

### **System Health Indicators**
- ✅ Documentation is consistent across all files
- ✅ Evidence organization follows naming conventions
- ✅ Evaluation results are archived and traceable
- ✅ Each phase builds on previous phases successfully
- ✅ End-to-end system functionality verified

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **"Agent seems confused about context"**
**Solution**: Check that agent prompt only references specific files, no conversation history

### **"Evaluation keeps failing"**
**Solution**: 
1. Review evaluation criteria for clarity
2. Check if implementation actually meets criteria
3. Verify evidence includes raw execution logs
4. Ensure no mocks or fallbacks in implementation

### **"Documentation is inconsistent"**
**Solution**:
1. Update `/docs/current_phase_status.md` first
2. Archive completed phase information
3. Update root CLAUDE.md to reflect current state
4. Verify all status documents align

### **"Phase seems to repeat work from previous phases"**
**Solution**:
1. Review phase objectives for clarity
2. Ensure phase builds on previous phases properly
3. Check that evidence location doesn't conflict
4. Verify phase numbering is sequential

## 🛡️ Operational Best Practices

### **Progress Monitoring & Quality Gates**

#### **Before Starting Each Phase**:
- [ ] Previous phase has 100% PASS from external evaluation
- [ ] Evidence committed to git with proper commit message
- [ ] Documentation updated and archived appropriately
- [ ] Current phase instructions reviewed for completeness
- [ ] Evaluation criteria clearly defined and measurable

#### **During Phase Implementation**:
- [ ] Implementation agent has only isolated instructions (zero context)
- [ ] Evidence location clearly specified and followed
- [ ] No shortcuts or "good enough" implementations
- [ ] All deliverables match specification exactly

#### **Before External Evaluation**:
- [ ] All evidence files present and executable
- [ ] Test outputs include raw logs (not just summaries)
- [ ] Working demonstrations deployable by external parties
- [ ] Evidence copied to clean evaluation directory
- [ ] Evaluation criteria accessible to external agent

#### **After External Evaluation**:
- [ ] Results documented in evaluation_result.md
- [ ] If PASS: Commit, archive, update status, plan next phase
- [ ] If FAIL: Launch remediation with specific feedback
- [ ] Never proceed with partial success

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

#### **Context Contamination Prevention**:
```bash
# Verify agent isolation before launch
echo "Implementation agent should only receive: phases/phase{N}_isolated/CLAUDE.md"
echo "Evaluation agent should only receive: evidence + evaluation_criteria.md"
echo "No conversation history, no other phases, no implementation context"
```

#### **Evidence Quality Assurance**:
- Require raw terminal output logs (not edited summaries)
- Include deployable system examples that can be tested
- Provide specific file paths and exact commands to run
- Test evidence packages independently before evaluation

#### **Fallback Recovery Procedures**:
```bash
# If documentation becomes inconsistent:
1. Review /docs/current_phase_status.md as single source of truth
2. Archive conflicting documents with timestamps
3. Update documentation to align with current reality

# If evidence location confusion:
1. Check phases/phase{N}_isolated/CLAUDE.md for specified location
2. Ensure evidence matches specification exactly
3. Copy to evaluation_clean/ directory for assessment

# If evaluation results unclear:
1. Require specific PASS/FAIL with numerical scores
2. Demand specific remediation requirements for failures
3. Re-evaluate until clear 100% PASS achieved
```

### **Communication Protocols**

#### **Agent Launch Templates**:
**Implementation Agent**:
```
Task: "You are an implementation agent for Phase {N}: {Phase Name}. 

IMPORTANT: You have NO context from previous conversations or implementations.

Your task: Read the complete implementation instructions in /home/brian/autocoder3_cc/phases/phase{N}_isolated/CLAUDE.md and implement the entire Phase {N} system according to those specifications.

Save all evidence to the location specified in the instructions. Create complete, working implementations with no mocks or placeholders."
```

**External Evaluation Agent**:
```
Task: "You are an external evaluator for Phase {N}: {Phase Name}.

IMPORTANT: You have NO knowledge of the implementation process or conversation history.

Your task: 
1. Read evaluation criteria: /home/brian/autocoder3_cc/phases/evaluation_clean/evaluation_criteria.md
2. Evaluate evidence: /home/brian/autocoder3_cc/phases/evaluation_clean/current_evidence/
3. Execute all code and verify all claims independently
4. Write results: /home/brian/autocoder3_cc/phases/evaluation_clean/phase{N}_evaluation_result.md

Provide objective PASS/FAIL with specific evidence-based justification."
```

#### **Remediation Agent**:
```
Task: "You are a remediation agent for Phase {N}: {Phase Name}.

The external evaluation found these specific failures: [paste evaluation results]

Your task: Fix ONLY the failed criteria in the evidence located at /home/brian/autocoder3_cc/evidence/phase{N}_*/. 

Address each failure systematically and re-test until all issues are resolved. Do not change unrelated code."
```

### **Success Tracking & Metrics**

#### **Phase Success Indicators**:
- ✅ External evaluation score: 100/100 points
- ✅ Test execution rate: >95% tests passing  
- ✅ Evidence completeness: All specified files present
- ✅ Deployment success: System deployable by external parties
- ✅ Performance targets: Meet specified benchmarks

#### **System Health Indicators**:
- ✅ Documentation consistency: All status files aligned
- ✅ Evidence organization: Clear naming and structure
- ✅ Git history: Clean commits after each phase
- ✅ Multi-agent isolation: Zero context leakage verified
- ✅ End-to-end functionality: Complete pipeline working

### **Continuous Improvement**

#### **After Each Phase**:
- Review what worked well in the multi-agent process
- Document any process improvements discovered
- Update templates and protocols based on lessons learned
- Archive detailed analysis for future reference

#### **Regular System Audits**:
- Verify documentation structure integrity  
- Check evidence locations match specifications
- Confirm git commit history tells complete story
- Validate end-to-end system functionality
