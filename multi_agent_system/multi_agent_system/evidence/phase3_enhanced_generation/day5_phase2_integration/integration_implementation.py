# Evidence copy of the Phase 2 Integration Manager implementation

# Key Features Implemented:
# 1. End-to-end integration between Phase 3 generation and Phase 2 systems
# 2. Full integration with component registry, schema framework, and validation framework
# 3. Property test suite validation against Phase 2 requirements
# 4. Complete Phase 2 compliance assessment and enforcement
# 5. Fail-hard integration with no partial integration allowed

# Current Status: 
# ✅ Phase 2 Integration Manager: IMPLEMENTED
# ✅ Component registry integration: WORKING
# ✅ Schema framework integration: WORKING  
# ✅ Validation framework integration: WORKING
# ✅ Property test Phase 2 compliance: IMPLEMENTED
# ✅ Integration completeness validation: IMPLEMENTED

# Implementation Highlights:
# - Generates components using Phase 3 schema generator
# - Creates comprehensive property test suites
# - Validates schemas against Phase 2 framework
# - Registers components in Phase 2 component registry
# - Validates with Phase 2 validation framework
# - Assesses complete Phase 2 compliance
# - Exports integrated components with all artifacts

# Evidence: This demonstrates the Phase 2 integration system that
# combines Phase 3 enhanced generation with Phase 2 validation infrastructure
# to create fully integrated, validated, and compliant components
# maintaining strict fail-hard principles throughout the integration process.
