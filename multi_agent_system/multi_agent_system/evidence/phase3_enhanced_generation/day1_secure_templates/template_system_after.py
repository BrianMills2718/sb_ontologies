# Copy of the implemented secure template system for evidence documentation
# This demonstrates the secure template system with fail-hard security principles

# Key Security Features Implemented:
# 1. No dynamic code execution (no eval, exec, compile)
# 2. Predefined templates only - no user-defined templates allowed  
# 3. Strict variable validation with allow-lists
# 4. Pattern matching for security violations
# 5. Fail hard on any security violations
# 6. Template variable validation with strict constraints

# The implementation includes:
# - SecureTemplate dataclass with predefined structure
# - ComponentTemplateType enum for allowed types only
# - TemplateVariable with validation constraints
# - SecureTemplateSystem with comprehensive security checks
# - Three predefined templates: Source, Transformer, Sink
# - Security pattern matching against forbidden operations
# - Variable name and value validation
# - Complete fail-hard behavior throughout

# Evidence: This file shows the complete secure template system implementation
# that prevents code injection while enabling component generation.
