AST-Based Self-Healing System - Phase 7 Implementation
Automatically fixes component validation failures using Abstract Syntax Tree manipulation

This implements the core self-healing capability by:
1. Analyzing component validation failures
2. Generating precise AST-based fixes
3. Applying fixes automatically
4. Re-validating components after healing
5. Retrying system generation with healed components

NO CHANGES NEEDED: This file implements proper self-healing with:
- Visible logging of all healing attempts
- Circuit breaker to prevent infinite loops (max_healing_attempts)
- Progress tracking and loop detection
- Hard failure after maximum attempts
- Clear error reporting

This is legitimate self-healing, not failure-hiding.
