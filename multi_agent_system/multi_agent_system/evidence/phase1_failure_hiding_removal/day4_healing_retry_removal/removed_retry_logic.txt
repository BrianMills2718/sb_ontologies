NO RETRY LOGIC REMOVED

Analysis of ast_self_healing.py shows it implements PROPER self-healing with:

‚úÖ GOOD PATTERNS (kept):
- max_healing_attempts with hard failure after limit
- Visible logging: "üîÑ Healing attempt {attempt + 1}/{max_healing_attempts}"
- Circuit breaker: "Circuit breaker activated - max attempts reached"
- Progress tracking: Detects stuck components and oscillating changes
- Hard failure: "‚ùå Self-healing failed after {attempt + 1} attempts"
- Error visibility: Components that fail healing are clearly reported

This is legitimate self-healing that SHOULD be preserved, not failure-hiding that should be removed.

The file correctly implements:
1. Bounded retry attempts (max_healing_attempts=3)
2. Prominent logging of all healing attempts
3. Hard failure when maximum attempts reached
4. Circuit breaker to prevent infinite loops
5. Progress detection to avoid oscillation

NO CHANGES REQUIRED.
