SELF-HEALING RETRY LOGIC ANALYSIS

The ast_self_healing.py file implements LEGITIMATE self-healing with proper bounds and visibility:

1. VISIBLE HEALING ATTEMPTS:
   - "üîÑ Healing attempt {attempt + 1}/{max_healing_attempts}"
   - "üîß Applied healing to {len(healed_components)} components" 
   - "‚ö†Ô∏è {len(components_stuck_in_loop)} components stuck in loops"

2. HARD FAILURE AFTER MAX ATTEMPTS:
   - Circuit breaker: "max_healing_attempts = 3"
   - Hard failure: "‚ùå Self-healing failed after {attempt + 1} attempts"
   - Error visibility: "‚ùå All failing components are stuck in healing loops"

3. PROGRESS TRACKING:
   - Detects code oscillation: "Oscillating changes detected"
   - Prevents infinite loops: "No progress detected - code unchanged"
   - Component-level circuit breaker

This is NOT failure-hiding but proper self-healing that:
- Makes healing attempts visible
- Fails hard when max attempts reached  
- Provides clear error messages
- Prevents infinite loops

NO CHANGES REQUIRED - this file implements correct patterns.
