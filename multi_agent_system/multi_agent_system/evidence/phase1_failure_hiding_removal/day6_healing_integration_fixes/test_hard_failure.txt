HEALING INTEGRATION HARD FAILURE VERIFICATION:

The healing_integration.py file implements proper hard failure patterns:

1. BOUNDED ATTEMPTS: max_healing_attempts=3 (configurable)
   - After 3 attempts, system fails hard
   - No infinite retry loops

2. VISIBLE FAILURES:
   - "‚ùå Max healing attempts reached"
   - "‚ùå Healing failed - cannot fix component issues"  
   - "‚ùå Exhausted all healing attempts without success"

3. CIRCUIT BREAKER DETECTION:
   - Detects when individual components hit their healing limits
   - Reports: "‚ö° Circuit breaker activated for one or more components"

4. DEFINITIVE FAILURE DETECTION:
   - Tracks components with "DEFINITIVE FAILURE" status
   - Reports: "‚ùå X components have definitive failures"

5. PROGRESS MONITORING:
   - Detects when "No progress detected" in healing
   - Reports: "üîÑ No progress detected in some components - potential healing loops"

6. HARD STOP CONDITIONS:
   - Returns False when healing cannot proceed
   - Sets clear error messages in result object
   - Prevents system generation from continuing

This implements PROPER self-healing with fail-hard principles, not failure-hiding anti-patterns.

The system correctly fails hard when:
- Maximum healing attempts are reached
- Circuit breakers activate for components
- No progress is detected in healing
- Components have definitive failures

NO CHANGES NEEDED - this is the correct implementation.
