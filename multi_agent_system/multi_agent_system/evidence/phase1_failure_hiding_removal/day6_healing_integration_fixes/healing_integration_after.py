# NO CHANGES NEEDED TO healing_integration.py

# This file implements PROPER self-healing patterns:

‚úÖ GOOD PATTERNS (preserved):
1. BOUNDED ATTEMPTS: max_healing_attempts=3 with hard failure after limit
2. VISIBLE LOGGING: "üîÑ Component validation attempt {attempt + 1}"
3. CIRCUIT BREAKER: Detects and reports "Circuit breaker activated"
4. PROGRESS TRACKING: Detects "No progress detected" and "DEFINITIVE FAILURE"
5. HARD FAILURE: "‚ùå Max healing attempts reached"
6. ERROR VISIBILITY: Clear reporting of what components failed and why

# This is legitimate self-healing that SHOULD be preserved.

# The healing loop properly:
# - Logs every healing attempt prominently 
# - Fails hard when maximum attempts reached
# - Detects and reports stuck components
# - Provides clear error messages
# - Prevents infinite loops with circuit breakers

# NO ANTI-PATTERNS FOUND - this file implements correct fail-hard self-healing.
