NO RETRY LOOPS REMOVED FROM healing_integration.py

ANALYSIS: This file implements PROPER self-healing patterns, not failure-hiding anti-patterns.

‚úÖ LEGITIMATE PATTERNS FOUND:
1. Bounded healing attempts (max_healing_attempts=3)
2. Visible logging of all healing attempts
3. Circuit breaker detection and reporting
4. Hard failure after maximum attempts
5. Progress tracking to detect stuck components
6. Clear error messages explaining failures

The healing loop at lines 199-288 correctly implements:
- "üîÑ Component validation attempt {attempt + 1}" - visible attempt logging
- "‚ùå Max healing attempts reached" - hard failure after limit
- "‚ö° Circuit breaker activated" - circuit breaker detection
- "‚ùå Exhausted all healing attempts without success" - final hard failure

This is GOOD self-healing that should be preserved, not removed.

The difference between good and bad retry logic:
‚ùå BAD: Silent retries, infinite loops, fallback modes
‚úÖ GOOD: Visible retries, bounded attempts, hard failure, error reporting

This file implements the GOOD patterns.

NO CHANGES REQUIRED.
