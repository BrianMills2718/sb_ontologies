COMPONENT SKIPPING ELIMINATION:

The validation framework previously allowed "skipping" components with unsupported types and would return a failed ValidationResult but continue processing.

NOW FAILS HARD:
- When unsupported component types are encountered, ValidationFailureError is raised immediately
- No partial system generation is allowed
- Clear error message explains which components are unsupported
- Forces developer to either add support for the component type or fix the blueprint

This prevents the anti-pattern of hiding incomplete system generation behind "component skipping" logic.

BEFORE: System would be marked as "failed" but processing would continue with partial components
AFTER: System generation stops immediately with clear error about unsupported components

This change ensures that:
1. All components in a blueprint must be supported
2. No partial/incomplete systems are generated
3. Missing component support is immediately visible
4. Developers get clear feedback about what needs to be implemented
