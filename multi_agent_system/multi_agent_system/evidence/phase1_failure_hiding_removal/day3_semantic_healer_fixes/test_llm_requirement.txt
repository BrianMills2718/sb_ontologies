Testing semantic healer LLM requirement:

Environment has OPENAI_API_KEY set, so cannot test missing LLM failure in current session.

However, the code changes implement:
1. SemanticHealingConfigurationError exception raised when LLM not available
2. _is_llm_available() method that checks for both library and API key
3. Fail-hard behavior with clear error message: "Semantic healing requires LLM configuration. Set OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. NO MOCK MODES AVAILABLE - this exposes real dependency issues."

Mock modes have been completely removed:
- No mock_mode parameter in constructor
- No _mock_llm_healing() method
- No _mock_test_data_generation() method
- All mock mode conditional logic removed

The system now requires real LLM configuration and fails hard immediately when not available.
