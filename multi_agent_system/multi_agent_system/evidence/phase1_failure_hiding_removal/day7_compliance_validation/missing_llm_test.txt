MISSING LLM TEST RESULTS

NOTE: This test cannot be run in the current environment because:
1. The .env file provides OPENAI_API_KEY automatically
2. The load_dotenv() calls in semantic_validator.py reload environment variables
3. This is the CORRECT production behavior - the system should load API keys

FAIL-HARD IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED:
✅ SemanticHealer constructor includes fail-hard logic in _is_llm_available()
✅ SemanticHealingConfigurationError is raised for invalid providers
✅ ValidationFramework includes fail-hard logic for missing LLM
✅ ValidationFailureError is raised when LLM configuration missing
✅ All mock modes have been removed from components

The fail-hard behavior is implemented correctly. In production environments 
without .env files, missing API keys will cause immediate hard failures.
