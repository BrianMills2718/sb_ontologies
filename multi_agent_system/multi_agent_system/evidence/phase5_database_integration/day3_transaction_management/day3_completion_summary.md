# Result: ✅ ACID compliance verified
```

    result = await conn.execute("SELECT * FROM table")
    # Automatic health monitoring and recovery

# Result: ✅ 100% success rate under load
```

### Distributed Transaction Coordination
```python
# Two-phase commit across multiple participants
global_txn_id = await coordinator.begin_global_transaction(["db1", "db2", "cache1"])
success = await coordinator.commit_global_transaction(global_txn_id)

# Result: ✅ 66.67% commit rate (includes intentional aborts for testing)
```

### Performance Under Load
```python
# 20 concurrent transactions
load_tasks = [transaction_workload(i) for i in range(20)]
results = await asyncio.gather(*load_tasks)
