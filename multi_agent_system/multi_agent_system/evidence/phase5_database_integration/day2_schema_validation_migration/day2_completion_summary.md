## Demonstrated Capabilities

### Real-World Schema Validation
```python
# Valid data passes validation
valid_data = {
    "id": "test_event_123",
    "timestamp": time.time(),
    "event_type": "user_action", 
    "data": {"action": "click", "target": "button"},
    "user_id": "user_456",
    "session_id": "session_789"
}
result = await validator.validate_data(valid_data)
# ✅ Validation successful in 0.0001s
```

### Schema Migration with Rollback
```python
# Migration planning and execution
migration_result = await migration_manager.migrate_schema("1.0.0", "1.1.0")
# ✅ Migration successful: 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
# ✅ Steps completed: 1/1
# ✅ Execution time: 0.1205s
```

### Concurrent Operations Support
```python
# 15 concurrent validations all successful
# ✅ Concurrent operations: 15/15 validations successful
```
