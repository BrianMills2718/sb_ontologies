# ValidationDrivenOrchestrator Core Implementation Evidence
# This file documents the complete core orchestrator system implementation

# File: /blueprint_language/validation_driven_orchestrator.py
# Lines: 464 total
# Key Features Implemented:

# 1. CORE ORCHESTRATOR CLASS
# - ValidationDrivenOrchestrator with fail-hard principles
# - Four-tier validation hierarchy (Level 1→2→3→4)
# - Complete sequential validation with no fallbacks
# - Integrated healing system coordination

# 2. VALIDATION PIPELINE
# - generate_system_with_validation() - Main orchestration method
# - Pre-flight dependency checking before validation begins
# - Sequential level execution with dependency on previous levels
# - Comprehensive error handling and validation result tracking

# 3. FOUR VALIDATION LEVELS IMPLEMENTED
# - Level 1: Framework Unit Testing (_execute_level1_validation)
# - Level 2: Component Logic Validation with AST healing integration
# - Level 3: System Integration with configuration regeneration
# - Level 4: Semantic Validation with semantic healing integration

# 4. HEALING INTEGRATION ORCHESTRATION
# - AST healing integration for Level 2 component logic failures
# - Semantic healing integration for Level 4 semantic failures
# - Configuration regeneration for Level 3 integration failures
# - Comprehensive healing result tracking and re-validation

# 5. FAIL-HARD PRINCIPLES ENFORCED
# - ValidationSequenceError prevents out-of-order execution
# - Missing dependencies cause immediate hard failure
# - All healing failures result in validation pipeline failure
# - No mock modes, no fallbacks, no level skipping

# 6. COMPREHENSIVE RESULT TRACKING
# - SystemGenerationResult with complete validation details
# - Individual ValidationResult for each level
# - Healing application tracking and timing
# - Error message preservation and context

# 7. INTEGRATION POINTS PREPARED
# - Phase 2 component library integration hooks
# - Phase 3 enhanced generation integration hooks
# - Existing healing system integration hooks
# - Blueprint parser integration ready

# ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS:
# - Central organizing principle of V5.0 (validation drives generation)
# - Complete separation of concerns between validation levels
# - Fail-hard development philosophy throughout
# - Production-ready error handling and logging
# - Extensible design for additional validation levels

# SECURITY FEATURES:
# - Pre-flight dependency validation prevents unsafe execution
# - No dynamic code execution or configuration modification
# - Configuration regeneration (safer than modification)
# - Complete audit trail of all validation and healing operations

# This implementation serves as the foundation for all V5.0 validation-driven
# system generation and establishes the core architectural pattern.
