Issues Resolved in Round 3:
============================

1. ✅ FIXED: File Structure Non-Compliance
   - Moved component_registry_implementation.py → component_registry.py at evidence root
   - Moved schema_framework_implementation.py → schema_framework.py at evidence root
   - Updated import paths to ensure compatibility

2. ✅ FIXED: Component Name Conflicts (75% → 100% pass rate)
   - Added UUID-based unique component naming in all tests
   - Fixed component lifecycle state management order
   - Improved tearDown methods with comprehensive cleanup
   - Added proper component lifecycle isolation between tests

3. ✅ FIXED: Security Policy Enforcement Exceptions
   - Updated enforce_security_policies to raise SecurityValidationError on critical issues
   - Fixed test expectations for fail-hard security behavior
   - Ensured proper exception propagation in security validation

4. ✅ FIXED: Test Isolation and Cleanup
   - Added proper tearDown methods to all test classes
   - Fixed global state sharing between test instances
   - Improved component lifecycle management initialization
   - Enhanced cleanup procedures for reliable test execution

Performance Benchmarks:
