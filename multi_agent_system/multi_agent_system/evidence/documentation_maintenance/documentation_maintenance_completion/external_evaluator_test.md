```

### Execution Requirements
- [ ] All Python files execute without errors
- [ ] Real repository data is processed (not mock data)
- [ ] Actual issues are identified and addressed
- [ ] Working demonstrations produce real output
- [ ] Integration with existing repository structure works

## Real-World Validation Tests

### Test 1: Documentation Inconsistency Detection
**Goal**: Verify the system finds real documentation issues

**Steps**:
1. Run the documentation audit system
2. Verify it identifies actual inconsistencies in the repository
3. Check that cross-file consistency validation works
4. Confirm real issues are reported with specific locations

**Expected Results**: System should identify actual documentation inconsistencies in the current repository state.

### Test 2: Git Change Processing
**Goal**: Verify git activity monitoring and categorization

**Steps**:
1. Run the git change monitor on recent repository history
2. Verify phase completion detection works
3. Check that change categorization is accurate
4. Confirm status tracking updates based on real commits

**Expected Results**: System should correctly categorize recent git changes and detect phase completions.

### Test 3: Evidence Quality Assessment
**Goal**: Verify evidence completeness checking

**Steps**:
1. Run evidence completeness checker on existing evidence packages
2. Verify scoring methodology is sound
3. Check that missing elements are correctly identified
4. Confirm recommendations are actionable

**Expected Results**: System should accurately assess evidence quality and provide specific improvement recommendations.

### Test 4: Enforcement Blocking
**Goal**: Verify enforcement mechanisms actually block problematic operations

**Steps**:
1. Run phase completion validator on current phase
2. Verify it correctly identifies completion readiness
3. Check that validation gates work as intended
4. Confirm blocking behavior for incomplete phases

**Expected Results**: System should correctly block phase completion if requirements are not met.

### Test 5: Integration with Multi-Agent Workflow
**Goal**: Verify integration with existing multi-agent system

**Steps**:
1. Review integration configuration
2. Verify workflow hooks are properly configured
3. Check that maintenance operations integrate with phase lifecycle
4. Confirm the system enhances rather than interferes with existing workflow

**Expected Results**: System should seamlessly integrate with the existing multi-agent phase completion workflow.

## Evaluation Scoring

### Pass/Fail Criteria
Each requirement must be **100% functional** for the phase to pass:

- **PASS**: All 6 requirements met, all systems operational, real issues detected and addressed
- **FAIL**: Any requirement not met, any system non-functional, or only mock/test data processed

### Common Failure Modes to Check
- [ ] Scripts that don't execute or have import errors
- [ ] Mock data instead of real repository analysis
- [ ] Systems that don't find actual issues in the repository
- [ ] Integration that doesn't work with existing multi-agent workflow
- [ ] Enforcement that doesn't actually block problematic operations
- [ ] Missing or incomplete evidence packages

## Notes for Evaluator

1. **Independence**: Evaluate based solely on the evidence provided, without consulting implementation details
2. **Real-World Focus**: Verify that systems work with real repository data, not just test cases
3. **Integration Testing**: Confirm systems work together as a cohesive maintenance framework
4. **Operational Readiness**: Assess whether the system is ready for production use
5. **Issue Detection**: Verify that real issues are found and addressed, not just theoretical capabilities

**Success Requirement**: 100% pass rate on all criteria for Documentation Maintenance Phase completion.
