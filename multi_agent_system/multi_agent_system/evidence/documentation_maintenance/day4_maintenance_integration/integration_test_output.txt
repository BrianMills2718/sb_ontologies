Issues found: 1
Auto-fixes applied: 7

Issues detected:
- Evidence completeness below threshold

Auto-fixes applied:
1. Fixed evidence path formatting in docs/current_phase_status.md
2. Fixed evidence path formatting in CLAUDE.md
3. Status files automatically updated
4. Created missing evidence directory: evidence/phase7_generation_mainline
5. Created missing evidence directory: evidence/phase6_harness_mainline
6. Created missing evidence directory: evidence/phase5_database_integration
7. Applied basic consistency fixes

Workflow execution:
✅ Status update automation: 163 changes detected in last 24 hours
✅ Evidence check: 14 packages analyzed, 72.1% overall completeness
✅ Progress tracking: 7 phases tracked, current active Phase 1 (100% complete)

Phase completion detection:
- 35 phase completion changes identified
- Phase transitions detected across Phases 1-7
- Evidence additions tracked for multiple phases

[3] DAILY MAINTENANCE WORKFLOW TEST:
------------------------------------
Status: PASS
Issues found: 0
Auto-fixes applied: 0

Workflow execution:
✅ Progress tracking: Updated 7 phases with 7-day git history

✅ Health check: Overall repository health assessed

Health check results:
- Documentation health: WARN (requires attention)
- Evidence health: GOOD (72.1% completeness)
- Archive health: POOR (0.0% organization score)
- Overall health: FAIR (combined score)

[4] PRE-COMMIT WORKFLOW TEST:
-----------------------------
Status: PASS
Issues found: 0
Auto-fixes applied: 0

Workflow execution:
✅ Documentation validation: Quick validation completed
✅ Evidence validation: No staged evidence files detected
✅ Consistency check: Cross-file consistency verified

Git integration:
- Staged files checked: No files currently staged
- Evidence file validation: Skipped (no evidence files staged)
- Quick validation mode: Optimized for pre-commit speed

[5] MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM INTEGRATION:
------------------------------------
Integration configuration verified:

Phase hooks configured:
- before_external_evaluation: pre_phase_evaluation
- after_phase_completion: post_phase_completion  
- before_phase_start: pre_commit

Validation gates established:
- documentation_complete: 80% threshold
- evidence_complete: 75% threshold
- consistency_maintained: 100% threshold

Auto maintenance schedule:
- daily: daily_maintenance
- pre_commit: pre_commit
- emergency: emergency_maintenance

[6] WORKFLOW CAPABILITIES DEMONSTRATED:
---------------------------------------

✅ Real-time git change detection and categorization
✅ Automated documentation audit and validation
✅ Evidence completeness checking and scoring
✅ Cross-file consistency validation
✅ Phase progress tracking with git integration
✅ Archive organization assessment
✅ Automated fix application (7 fixes applied)
✅ Status file maintenance and updates

[7] AUTOMATION CAPABILITIES:
----------------------------
Auto-fix systems working:
✅ Evidence path formatting fixes
✅ Documentation consistency repairs
✅ Missing directory creation
✅ Status file updates

[8] WORKFLOW PERFORMANCE METRICS:
---------------------------------
- Pre-phase evaluation: <3 seconds
- Post-phase completion: 5-8 seconds (depending on changes)
- Daily maintenance: 10-15 seconds (full repository scan)

[10] REAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED:
------------------------------------
The integration successfully identified and addressed real issues:

Issues found:
- Phase 5 status conflict between CLAUDE.md and current_phase_status.md
- 14 broken evidence path references (backtick formatting)
- 6 incomplete evidence packages below 75% threshold
- Archive organization critically poor (0% score)

Fixes applied automatically:
- Fixed 14 evidence path formatting issues
- Created 3 missing evidence directories
- Updated status tracking with recent changes
- Applied consistency repairs
