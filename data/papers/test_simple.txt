Test Paper: Simple Hypergraph Theory

Authors: Test Author

Abstract:
This paper introduces hypergraphs as a generalization of graphs where edges can connect multiple vertices. A hyperedge is a subset of vertices, and hypergraphs are useful for modeling n-ary relationships.

Key Concepts:
- Hypergraph: A generalization of a graph
- Hyperedge: An edge connecting multiple vertices
- Vertex: A node in the hypergraph

The main contribution is showing that hypergraphs can model complex relationships better than simple graphs.
