Carter Presidential Speech on Soviet Relations, 1977

I feel more secure as President making decisions if I know that the most difficult, complex questions that face me have been understood and debated by Congress and the American people.

For decades, our foreign policy revolved around antagonism between two coalitions, one headed by the United States and the other headed by the Soviet Union. Our national security was often defined almost exclusively in terms of military competition with the Soviet Union.

In the talks on strategic arms limitations, the SALT talks, we advanced a comprehensive proposal for genuine reductions and limitations that would maintain balanced strategic strength.
