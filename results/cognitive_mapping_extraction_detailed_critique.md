# Detailed Critique: Cognitive Mapping Multi-Pass Extraction

## Critical Schema Structure Failures

### 1. **WRONG SCHEMA FORMAT**
The extraction completely ignored the meta_schema_8 structure!

**Expected Structure (per meta_schema_8):**
```json
{
  "WorldView_Theory": {
    "metadata": {...},
    "classification": {...},
    "schema": {
      "Ontology": {
        "entities": [...],
        "connections": [...],
        "properties": [...],
        "modifiers": [...]
      },
      "Process": {...},
      "Telos": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

**What Was Generated:**
```json
{
  "theory": "Cognitive Mapping...",
  "version": "v8.0",
  "classification": {...},
  "telos": "A symbolic...",
  "ontology": [  // FLAT LIST - WRONG!
    {"indigenous_term": "equal =", ...},
    {"indigenous_term": "positive-cause +", ...},
    // Everything mixed together
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Mixed Categories**
The extraction put everything in one flat list, mixing:
- Relationships (positive-cause, negative-cause, etc.)
- Actions (accept, allow, assist, etc.)
- Modifiers (past, present, future, etc.)
- Core concepts (concept, cognitive map, semantic network)

### 3. **Missing Core Entities**
According to the paper, the fundamental entities are:
- **Concepts**: Nodes in the cognitive map (the things being related)
- **Relationships**: Links between concepts
- **Statements**: Complete subject-relationship-object structures

But the extraction treats "concept" as just another term in the flat list!

### 4. **Incorrect Classification**
The paper clearly distinguishes:
1. **Concepts** (entities/nodes) - e.g., "United States", "peace", "SALT"
2. **Relationships** (connections) - the 13 types like positive-cause, attribute
3. **Actions** (special type of connections) - the 50 action verbs
4. **Modifiers** (temporal/modal qualifiers) - past, present, future, goal, hypothetical, normative

### 5. **Missing Key Components**

**Truth Values** (completely missed):
- true
- false  
- partial
- possible
- impossible

**Structural Elements** (missed):
- Synonym facility
- Salience (frequency/importance)
- Conjunctions (and, or)

### 6. **Process Description Absent**
The paper describes a clear process:
1. Code text into statements
2. Build semantic network
3. Apply synonym facility
4. Calculate structural measures
5. Compare/analyze maps

None of this was captured in a Process section.

### 7. **Metrics Not Properly Structured**
The paper defines specific metrics:
- Dependency (DG)
- Connectedness (CG)
- Size
- Uniformity of salience
- Transformation cost
- Incongruence

These should be in an Analytics section with formulas.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Multi-pass didn't enforce schema structure** - It successfully extracted all terms but failed to organize them according to meta_schema_8

2. **Final assembly step failed** - The LLM ignored the meta-schema structure in favor of creating its own simplified format

3. **No validation of structure** - The system validated term completeness but not structural correctness

## What The Extraction Should Look Like

## Recommendations

1. **Enforce schema structure** in the final assembly step
2. **Add structural validation** to ensure output conforms to meta_schema_8
3. **Provide clearer categorization guidance** in the prompts
4. **Test extraction against expected structure**, not just term count
