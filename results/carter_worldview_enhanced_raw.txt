────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 3: CONSTRUCT THE SEMANTIC NETWORK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Below is a high-level schematic (not every node repeated) showing how concepts (CAPS) and reified relationships connect. In practice, each relationship can itself be a node if it has its own attributes or modifiers.

 • CARTER  
   ├─(attribute)─► PRESIDENT  
   ├─(action: “learned a lot”)─► LEARNING_EXPERIENCE [past 6 months]  
   ├─(strategy)─► OPEN_DISCUSSIONS_WITH_AMERICANS  
   ├─(strategy)─► RESTORE_MORAL_BEARINGS  
   ├─(strategy)─► BUILD_RECIPROCAL_US_SOVIET_TIES  

 • CONGRESS  
   ├─(action)─► TREATED_CARTER_AS_GA_GOV (temporal: past)  

 • CARTER + CONGRESS  
   └─(relationship)─► IMPROVED_RELATIONSHIP  
       (modifiers: normative = “should exist”)  

 • SOUTHERN_STATES  
   ├─(attribute)─► TRADITION_OF_LOCAL_GOVERNMENT  
   └─(attribute)─► FEEL_RAPID_CHANGES  

 • US & USSR (“TWO_INDUSTRIAL_GIANTS”)  
   ├─(overlapping_interests)─► SHARED_INTERESTS  
   ├─(face)─► ENERGY_CRISIS  
   └─(competition)─► MILITARY_BALANCE  

 • SALT (STRATEGIC_ARMS_LIMITATION_TALKS)  
   ├─(proposal_by_US)─► REDUCTIONS_LIMITS_FREEZE  
   ├─(if-then)─► IF_THREATS_CONTROLLED_THEN_LIMIT_US_STRATEGIC_PROGRAMS  
   └─(if-then)─► IF_NO_AGREEMENT_THEN_US_ENSURE_SECURITY  

 • HUMAN_RIGHTS  
   ├─(CARTER_ADMIN_position)─► APPLIES_TO_ALL_NATIONS  
   └─(SOVIET_LEADERS_belief)─► “MISINTERPRETED_AS_TARGETING_USSR”  

 • DESIRE_FOR_PEACE (reified concept)  
   ├─(SOVIETS)─► YEARN_FOR_PEACE  
   └─(AMERICANS)─► YEARN_FOR_PEACE  
       (leaders have normative obligation to realize)  

Note that “compounds” like IF-THEN statements can themselves be reified nodes. For instance, (IF_THREATS_CONTROLLED_THEN_LIMIT_ARMS) can be a node that “belongs to” SALT negotiations, with its own truth-value or temporal constraints.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 4: APPLY SYNONYM FACILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• “Jimmy Carter,” “Carter,” “President Carter” → unify as CARTER.  
• “USSR,” “Soviet Union,” “Soviets” → unify as USSR.  
• “Southern Legislative Conference,” “SLC” → unify as SLC.  
• “Human rights concern,” “human rights stance,” “commitment to human rights” → unify as HUMAN_RIGHTS_POLICY.  

Likewise, “ban nuclear tests,” “halt nuclear proliferation,” “SALT proposals limiting nuclear arms” are all specialized subnodes under the broader category ARMS_CONTROL_POLICY but remain distinct concepts if needed for clarity.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 5: CONDUCT ANALYSIS / REASONING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Below are illustrative metrics from the WorldView framework:

1) SIZE  
   • Count of unique concepts (nodes) in the network.  
   • By cursory grouping, ~25–30 distinct concept-nodes appear (e.g., CARTER, CONGRESS, USSR, SLC, BILLY_CARTER, PRESIDENT, HUMAN_RIGHTS, SALT, etc.).  
   • size(G) ≈ 30  

2) CONNECTEDNESS  
   • C(G) = (#relationships) / (#concepts + #relationships).  
   • Roughly ~65 relationships extracted, ~30 concepts.  
   • #concepts + #relationships = 30 + 65 = 95.  
   • Then C(G) = 65 / 95 ≈ 0.68.  
   • Interpretation: The map is fairly interconnected, showing many statements link overlapping concepts.  

3) DEPENDENCY  
   • D(G) = [(#bridges / #relationships)] / (#structures).  
   • “Bridges” are relationships essential for linking subgraphs. Suppose ~10 relationships are bridging distinct sub-networks (e.g., SALT negotiations bridging “Carter” and “USSR”).  
   • #relationships = 65, #structures (rough subgraphs) ~ 1 large subgraph and 2–3 smaller attachments, so #structures ≈ 3 or 4.  
   • Estimate D(G) ≈ (10/65) / 3 = 10/65/3 ≈ 0.051.  
   • Interpretation: Low–moderate dependency; the map is mostly integrated into a single cluster, with some bridging lines.  

4) TRANSFORMATION COST (hypothetical comparison)  
   • Not computed here since we have only one map. If we compared Carter’s map to (say) Brezhnev’s, we would count how many edits (add or remove edges/concepts) are needed.  

5) NORMATIVE / MODAL STATEMENTS  
   • Many references to “should,” “need to,” “responsibility.” These reflect the normative emphasis on peace, arms control, and moral grounding.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CONCLUDING INSIGHTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Carter’s belief structure emphasizes open government, moral principles, arms control, and multilateral cooperation.  
• Human-rights advocacy is portrayed as universal, not anti-Soviet.  
• A major focus is the idea that US–USSR relations shape world peace, but are only one part of a broader global system also involving energy, development, and interdependence.  
• The map’s moderate-to-high connectedness reflects Carter’s integrated worldview, linking domestic governance (Congress, state legislatures) to global arms control and human rights.  

This completes the five-step WorldView analysis for President Carter’s Charleston speech, capturing dense subject–relationship–object statements in a semantic network, applying relevant modifiers, merging synonyms, and illustrating core structural and comparative metrics.
