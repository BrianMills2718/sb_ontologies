# Cognitive Mapping Extraction Critique

## What Was Missed

### 1. Actions (50 items completely missed)
The paper clearly lists 50 action types in Table 1 under "Actions":
- accept, feel, purchase, allow, honor, ratify, assert, ignore, reduce
- assist, influence, release, attack, intervene, restore, cause, invade, share
- lose, lead, sign, confront, limit, stop, consider, maintain, support
- consult, meet, threaten, control, monitor, use, cooperate, negotiate, verify
- decide, open, visit, defend, order, vote-on, delay, organize, withdraw
- enforce, perform, yield-to, enhance, propose

**These are NOT just examples - they are the complete set of coding categories for actions in WorldView**

### 2. Additional Relationships (9 items partially missed)
From Table 1 "Relationships" section:
- equal (=)
- condition
- component  
- preference/greater-than (>)
- know
- location
- possess
- strategy
- warrant-for

Only 5 were captured: positive-cause, negative-cause, attribute, if-then, is-a

### 3. Critical Context
The paper states: "These categories can be broadly divided into two types: (1) relationships between concepts and (2) actions of agents."

This fundamental distinction between relationships and actions was completely lost in the extraction.

## Why This Matters

1. **Theory Fidelity**: The WorldView system's core innovation is its differentiated coding scheme. Missing 50 out of ~65 total categories means we've lost ~77% of the theory's vocabulary.

2. **Operational Impact**: Any attempt to apply this schema to real text would fail because the vast majority of verbs/actions in political text would have no corresponding category.

3. **Misrepresentation**: The extraction makes it seem like WorldView is primarily about graph structure (nodes and edges) when it's actually about a comprehensive coding scheme for political beliefs and actions.

## Root Cause Analysis

The extraction likely failed because:
1. **Truncation**: The paper was truncated to 80k characters, possibly cutting off Table 1
2. **Table Detection**: The LLM may have difficulty parsing the compact table format
3. **Focus Bias**: The prompt emphasizes "theory" over "implementation details" - but these categories ARE the theory

## Recommendation

This demonstrates the need for:
1. Multi-pass extraction specifically targeting tables and lists
2. Validation against expected component counts
3. Special handling for papers that define extensive taxonomies/ontologies
