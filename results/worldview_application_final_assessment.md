# Final Assessment: WorldView Application Attempts

## Comparison of Three Approaches

### 1. First Attempt (Partial Schema)
- **What was passed**: Only vocabulary (entities, relationships, actions, modifiers)
- **What was missing**: Telos, Process, Classification, Analytics
- **Results**: 
  - 15 trivial statements (Billy Carter, travel plans)
  - Missed all substantive foreign policy content
  - No compound statements
  - **Fidelity: ~25%**

### 2. Second Attempt (Focused on Purpose)
- **What was passed**: Vocabulary + manually added purpose context
- **What was added**: Telos info, paper's stated purpose, focus on foreign policy
- **Results**:
  - 4 core beliefs about international relations
  - 4 foreign policy positions (SALT, nuclear, human rights)
  - 2 compound statements found
  - **Fidelity: ~70%**

### 3. Third Attempt (Complete Schema)
- **What was passed**: EVERYTHING - Classification, Process, Telos, Ontology, Analytics
- **What was emphasized**: Follow the Process steps exactly
- **Results**:
  - Followed all 5 Process steps systematically
  - 10 belief statements (still relatively few)
  - Computed network measures
  - Generated inferences and predictions
  - **Fidelity: ~85%**

## Key Findings

### 1. Process Steps Made a Difference
The complete schema application actually followed WorldView's methodology:
- IdentifyBeliefs → RepresentBeliefs → SynonymAggregation → ComputeMeasures → ReasoningModel

This structured approach produced more systematic results.

### 2. Still Missing the SALT Example
Despite three attempts, none captured Young's key example:
- "If SALT becomes only the lowest common denominator that can be agreed upon easily..."
This suggests the speech text might not contain this exact quote, or the LLM isn't recognizing complex conditional patterns.

### 3. Statement Extraction Still Limited
Even the best attempt only extracted 10 statements from a lengthy speech. Young's paper suggests much denser extraction - potentially every sentence contains codable beliefs.

### 4. Quality Improved with Context
Clear progression in quality:
- Attempt 1: Trivial content (Billy Carter)
- Attempt 2: Foreign policy focus (SALT, nuclear weapons)
- Attempt 3: Systematic methodology (measured network properties)

## What Made the Difference

### Critical Success Factors:
1. **Telos (Purpose)**: Knowing it's for analyzing political beliefs about international relations
2. **Process (Methodology)**: Having step-by-step instructions for extraction
3. **Classification**: Understanding it's a Graph-based analysis
4. **Focus Guidance**: Explicitly stating to ignore trivial content

### Schema Components by Importance:
1. **Essential**: Telos, Process, Ontology
2. **Very Important**: Classification, Analytics
3. **Important**: Axioms (if present)
4. **Not Needed**: Citation metadata

## Remaining Gaps

### 1. Density of Extraction
- Young's method likely extracts 50-100+ statements from a speech
- Our best attempt found only 10
- Need better guidance on what constitutes a "statement"

### 2. Compound Statement Handling
- WorldView's key innovation is barely utilized
- Need explicit examples of how to identify and code nested statements

### 3. Relationship Richness
- Only used 5 relationship types out of 14+ available
- Need better guidance on when to use each relationship type

## Conclusions

1. **Complete Schema is Necessary**: Passing the full schema (except citations) produces dramatically better results than partial information.

2. **Process Steps are Crucial**: The methodology embedded in the Process section guides proper application.

3. **Purpose Context is Essential**: Without understanding what the theory is FOR, applications focus on wrong content.

4. **Still Room for Improvement**: Even with complete schema, the extraction density and sophistication could be much higher.

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Create Application Examples**: Include sample extractions in the schema showing proper density and complexity.

2. **Enhance Process Steps**: Add more specific guidance about statement identification and relationship selection.

3. **Compound Statement Templates**: Provide patterns for recognizing and coding nested structures.

4. **Validation Metrics**: Include expected extraction density (statements per paragraph) in success criteria.
