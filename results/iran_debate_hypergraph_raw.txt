Below are four illustrative “key statements” from the debate text, each analyzed using the 3-step Semantic Hypergraph process. For each statement, you will see:

1) The original text excerpt.  
2) Alpha (token‐level) classification.  
3) Beta (hyperedge) transformation.  
4) Any further decomposition if needed.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STATEMENT 1. (Iran’s nuclear program)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Original Text  
“U.S. intelligence had consistently assessed that Iran was not engaged in weapons research.”

2) Alpha Classification  
• U.S. → C  
• intelligence → C  
• had → (discarded: auxiliary)  
• consistently → M  
• assessed → P  
• that → (discarded)  
• Iran → C  
• was → (discarded: auxiliary)  
• not → M  
• engaged → P  
• in → T  
• weapons → C  
• research → C  

3) Beta Transformation (Final Hyperedge)  

Step-by-step assembly:

a) Combine “weapons/C” and “research/C” into a multi-word concept:  
   (+/B weapons/C research/C) ⇒ type C  

b) Turn “in/T (+/B weapons/C research/C)” into a specifier (S), via (T [C]) → S:  
   (in/T (+/B weapons/C research/C)) ⇒ S  

c) Combine “not/M engaged/P,” with its arguments “Iran/C” and the specifier above.  
   By rule (M x) → x, the modifier “not/M” attaches to “engaged/P” but does not change the overall type (still a predicate).  
   Final subrelation: ((not/M engaged/P) iran/C (in/T (+/B weapons/C research/C))) ⇒ type R  

d) Now “consistently/M assessed/P” is the top-level predicate with two arguments:  
   – subject: (+/B u.s./C intelligence/C)  (a multi-word concept)  
   – object: the subrelation above  

Hence the final relation:

( (consistently/M assessed/P)  
   (+/B u.s./C intelligence/C)  
   ((not/M engaged/P) iran/C (in/T (+/B weapons/C research/C)))  
)

→ This is of type R (predicate + arguments).

4) Decomposed Relations  
None further needed here.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STATEMENT 2. (Policy position: Bret Stephens on Trump’s strikes)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Original Text  
“Bret Stephens applauds President Trump’s strikes in Iran.”

2) Alpha Classification  
• Bret → C  
• Stephens → C  
• applauds → P  
• President → C  
• Trump’s → (possessive folded into a builder/“of”)  
• strikes → C  
• in → T  
• Iran → C  

3) Beta Transformation (Final Hyperedge)

a) Multi-word concept for person:  
   (+/B bret/C stephens/C) ⇒ type C  

b) “President Trump” as multi-word concept:  
   (+/B president/C trump/C) ⇒ C  

c) “strikes in Iran”:  
   – “in/T iran/C” → by (T [C]) → S → (in/T iran/C)  
   – Combine “strikes/C” with that specifier in a builder:  
       (+/B strikes/C (in/T iran/C)) ⇒ type C  
     (Builder + Concept + Specifier → Concept)  

d) Possessive “President Trump’s strikes in Iran” modeled as a second builder (often “of/B” or “+/B” in this theory):  
   (of/B (+/B president/C trump/C) (+/B strikes/C (in/T iran/C))) ⇒ type C  

e) Main predicate “applauds/P,” with subject and object:  
   (applauds/P  
      (+/B bret/C stephens/C)  
      (of/B (+/B president/C trump/C) (+/B strikes/C (in/T iran/C)))  
   )  
⇒ This whole structure is a relation (predicate + arguments).

4) Decomposed Relations  
No additional decomposition.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STATEMENT 3. (Policy position: Rosemary Kelanic warns the U.S.)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Original Text  
“Rosemary Kelanic warns the United States against striking Iran.”

2) Alpha Classification  
• Rosemary → C  
• Kelanic → C  
• warns → P  
• the → (discarded)  
• United → C  
• States → C  
• against → T  (used as a ‘trigger‐like’ preposition here)  
• striking → P  
• Iran → C  

3) Beta Transformation (Final Hyperedge)

a) Combine “Rosemary/C” and “Kelanic/C”:  
   (+/B rosemary/C kelanic/C) ⇒ C  

b) Combine “United/C” and “States/C”:  
   (+/B united/C states/C) ⇒ C  
   (Often we keep "the" discarded.)

c) “against/T” combined with “(strike/P iran/C)” → (T + R → specifier S).  
   First form the sub-relation “(strike/P iran/C)”, which is R.  
   Then combine with “against/T”: (against/T (strike/P iran/C)) ⇒ S  

d) Main relation with “warns/P” having three arguments:  
   (warns/P  
      (+/B rosemary/C kelanic/C)  
      (+/B united/C states/C)  
      (against/T (strike/P iran/C))  
   )  
⇒ Type R (predicate + subject + object + specifier).

4) Decomposed Relations  
None further.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STATEMENT 4. (Historical event: Netanyahu’s 1992 warning)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Original Text  
“Benjamin Netanyahu warned the Israeli Knesset in 1992 that Iran was a few years away from a nuclear bomb.”

2) Alpha Classification  
• Benjamin → C  
• Netanyahu → C  
• warned → P  
• the → (discarded)  
• Israeli → C  
• Knesset → C  
• in → T  
• 1992 → C  
• that → (discarded)  
• Iran → C  
• was → (discarded: auxiliary)  
• a → (discarded)  
• few → M  
• years → C  
• away → (often treated as an adverb or qualifier, can fold into a builder)  
• from → T  
• nuclear → C  
• bomb → C  

3) Beta Transformation (Final Hyperedge)

a) Speaker: (+/B benjamin/C netanyahu/C) ⇒ C  
b) Audience: (+/B israeli/C knesset/C) ⇒ C  
c) Time specifier: (in/T 1992/C) ⇒ S  

d) “Iran was a few years away from a nuclear bomb.”  
   Let us treat “few → M,” “years → C,” and “away … from nuclear bomb” as a nested builder + specifier. One concise way:

   i) Combine “nuclear/C” and “bomb/C”:  
      (+/B nuclear/C bomb/C) ⇒ C  
   ii) “from/T (+/B nuclear/C bomb/C)” ⇒ specifier (S)  
   iii) “(+/B few/M years/C (from/T (+/B nuclear/C bomb/C)))” ⇒ treat this as a concept describing “(few years away from …).”  
      • Because builder + concept + specifier still yields type C.  

   iv) The main subrelation: (be/P iran/C (+/B few/M years/C (from/T (+/B nuclear/C bomb/C)))) ⇒ type R.  

e) Full “warned/P” with four arguments (subject, object, time, content):  
   (warned/P  
     (+/B benjamin/C netanyahu/C)  
     (+/B israeli/C knesset/C)  
     (in/T 1992/C)  
     (be/P iran/C (+/B few/M years/C (from/T (+/B nuclear/C bomb/C))))  
   )  
⇒ Type R.

4) Decomposed Relations  
No additional decomposition here, though in extended analyses one might split off time specifiers.

SUMMARY  
Each example follows the same pattern:  
• Step 1 (Alpha): Assign every meaningful token an atomic type (C, P, B, T, J, M) or discard.  
• Step 2 (Beta): Apply the type-inference rules and builders to form well‐typed hyperedges (R or S).  
• Step 3 (Optional decomposition): If there were conjunctions (J) or further simplifications, we would add them here.

In this way, the key claims about Iran’s nuclear program, international/diplomatic relations, policy arguments, and historical warnings are each represented as a recursive, ordered hypergraph.
