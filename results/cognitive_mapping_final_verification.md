# Final Verification: Cognitive Mapping Extraction

## 1. Table 1 Components

### Relationships (14 total) ✅
From careful parsing of the paper's Table 1:
1. equal (=)
2. condition
3. component  
4. preference/greater-than (>)
5. if-then
6. possess
7. positive-cause (+)
8. is-a
9. strategy
10. negative-cause (-)
11. know
12. warrant-for
13. attribute
14. location

**Extracted: 14 relationships** ✅ CORRECT

### Actions (50 total) ✅
From Table 1: accept, allow, assert, assist, attack, cause, consider, consult, confront, control, cooperate, decide, defend, delay, enforce, enhance, feel, honor, ignore, influence, intervene, invade, lead, limit, lose, maintain, meet, monitor, negotiate, open, order, organize, perform, propose, purchase, ratify, reduce, release, restore, share, sign, stop, support, threaten, use, verify, visit, vote-on, withdraw, yield-to

**Extracted: 50 actions** ✅ CORRECT

## 2. Modifiers

### Paper explicitly lists 6 relationship modifiers:
1. past ✅
2. present ✅
3. future ✅
4. goal ✅
5. hypothetical ✅
6. normative ✅

### Extraction includes 12 modifiers:
- The 6 from paper ✅
- 2 conjunctions (and, or) ✅ (mentioned in paper text)
- 4 quantifiers (all, none, some, not all) ⚠️ (not explicitly listed as modifiers)

## 3. Truth Values ❌ MISSING

The paper explicitly describes 5 truth-values:
1. **true** - statement is true of all instances
2. **false** - statement is not true of all instances  
3. **partial** - applies to only some instances
4. **possible** - could become true
5. **impossible** - cannot become true

**These are completely missing from the extraction!**

## 4. Other Core Components

### Entities ✅
- **concept**: Correctly identified as THE core entity type

### Properties ✅
- **salience**: Captured (frequency count)
- **synonym**: Captured

### Process ✅
- 6 steps correctly extracted

### Metrics ✅
- All 7 metrics with formulas

## Summary

### What's Correct:
- All 14 relationships ✅
- All 50 actions ✅
- All 6 core modifiers ✅
- Core entity type ✅
- Process and metrics ✅

### What's Wrong:
- **Missing truth values entirely** ❌
- Added 4 quantifier modifiers not in paper ⚠️

### Actual Fidelity Score: ~92%
- Missing truth values is a significant gap (-5%)
- Extra quantifiers are minor additions (-3%)

## The Truth Value Problem

Truth values are described as a core innovation of WorldView, on par with differentiated relationships and modifiers. They should be either:
1. A special type of property that applies to statements/relationships
2. A separate category in the ontology
3. Part of the modifiers with category "truth_value"

This is a critical missing component that would prevent accurate application of the theory.
