# Simplified Meta-Schema Extraction Results

## Overview
Tested the new 4-component meta-schema (Nodes/Units, Connections, Properties, Modifiers) on both Semantic Hypergraph and Young 1996 papers.

## Semantic Hypergraph Results

### What Was Captured Successfully ✅
1. **All 8 type codes** (C, P, M, B, T, J, R, S) - correctly identified as nodes/units
2. **Special symbols** (+/B for compound builder, :/J for implicit sequence)
3. **All 5 type inference rules** with correct patterns and results
4. **Recursive, ordered nature** of hyperedges properly described
5. **Role codes** mentioned in connection properties (s, p, a, c, o, i, m, a)
6. **Model type** correctly identified as "hypergraph"

### Comparison with Previous Attempts
| Aspect | Multi-Pass | Option 2 | Simplified |
|--------|------------|----------|------------|
| Type codes | 0 ❌ | 8 ✅ | 8 ✅ |
| Inference rules | 0 ❌ | 0 ❌ | 5 ✅ |
| Special symbols | 15 ✓ | 9 ✓ | 2 ✓ |
| Model type | hypergraph ✅ | N/A | hypergraph ✅ |

### Key Insight
The simplified approach worked because:
- We asked for "nodes/units" → LLM listed all type codes as fundamental units
- We asked for "rules" → LLM found the type inference rules
- We didn't force categorization → Everything stayed in its natural form

## Young 1996 Results  

### What Was Captured Successfully ✅
1. **3 node classes** (concept, relationship, conjunction) - properly abstracted
2. **All relationship types** listed under notation.type_codes
3. **All action verbs** (44 captured!)
4. **Truth values and modifiers** (true, false, partial, possible, impossible, past, present, future, goal, hypothetical, normative)
5. **Structural measures** (dependency, connectedness, size, etc.)
6. **8 rules** including relationship-as-node elevation and calculations
7. **Model type** identified as "network" (semantic network)

### Notable Improvements
- Correctly identified that Young elevates relationships to nodes
- Captured the subject-of/object-of/member-of-conjunction connection types
- Found all the transformation and comparison algorithms

## Comparison: Old 8-Category vs New 4-Component

### Semantic Hypergraph
**Old approach problems:**
- Tried to force P (predicate) into "relationship" category
- Confused B (builder) - is it relationship or operator?
- Type inference rules had no category

**New approach success:**
- All type codes are just "nodes/units" with different types
- Hyperedges are the connections
- Type inference goes under "rules"
- Clean and natural mapping

### Young 1996
**Old approach problems:**
- Artificially separated "cooperate" (action) from "United States" (entity)
- Over-categorized everything into 8 buckets

**New approach success:**
- Everything is just a concept node
- Relationships are the typed edges
- Modifiers annotate the relationships
- Much simpler and true to the theory

## Key Advantages of Simplified Meta-Schema

1. **Theory-First**: We let each theory define its own structure
2. **No Forced Categories**: Units are whatever the theory says they are
3. **Natural Representation**: Hypergraphs stay hypergraphs, graphs stay graphs
4. **Complete Capture**: Rules, notation, and patterns have a clear place
5. **Simpler Prompts**: Asking for 4 components is clearer than 8 categories

## Remaining Gaps

### Semantic Hypergraph
- Still missing complete argument role table (only got 8, should be 10)
- Pattern library could be more extensive
- Examples of complete hyperedge parsing not captured

### Young 1996  
- Didn't extract specific concepts from Carter's speech (just the framework)
- Missing the actual cognitive map instance with 48 concepts
- Salience calculations not detailed

## Recommendations

1. **Use simplified meta-schema going forward** - it's more flexible and natural
2. **Add targeted extraction** for specific elements (e.g., "find all tables")
3. **Two-phase approach**: 
   - Phase 1: Extract theoretical framework (what we just did)
   - Phase 2: Apply framework to example text
4. **Preserve original notation** rather than translating to our categories

## Conclusion

The simplified 4-component meta-schema significantly outperformed the 8-category approach:
- **Semantic Hypergraph**: Captured type system and rules that were previously missed
- **Young 1996**: Natural representation without artificial categorization
- **Both theories**: Clean extraction with proper model type identification

This validates that letting theories define their own structure, rather than forcing predefined categories, leads to more faithful and complete extractions.
