# Multi-Pass Extraction vs Option 2 Critique Comparison

## Overview
Comparing what Option 2 critique identified as missing vs what the multi-pass extractor captured.

## 1. Type System

### Expected (from Option 2 critique):
- **8 type codes**: C, P, M, B, T, J, R, S
- **Type details from Table 1**: Which types can be Atom vs Non-atom
- **Type inference rules from Table 2**: 
  - (M x) → x
  - (B C C+) → C
  - (T [CR]) → S
  - (P [CRS]+) → R
  - (J x y'+) → x

### Multi-Pass Results:
- **Type codes found**: 0 ❌
- **Tables found**: 0 ❌
- **Inference rules found**: 0 ❌

**Gap**: The multi-pass extractor completely missed Table 1 and Table 2, even though they contain the core type system.

## 2. Argument Role System

### Expected (from Option 2 critique):
- **10 predicate roles from Table 3**:
  - s - active subject
  - p - passive subject  
  - a - agent (passive)
  - c - subject complement
  - o - direct object
  - i - indirect object
  - t - parataxis
  - j - interjection
  - x - specification
  - r - relative relation
- **Builder roles**: m (main), a (auxiliary)

### Multi-Pass Results:
- **Role codes found**: 0 ❌
- **Builder roles mentioned**: Yes, in algorithm notes ✓

**Gap**: Table 3 was completely missed.

## 3. Pattern Language Syntax

### Expected:
- **Wildcards**: X..., {sc}, [sp], -sp
- **Rule notation**: → (not ->)
- **Pattern matching details**: depth-first search with backtracking
- **Many pattern examples** beyond the 3 in Option 2

### Multi-Pass Results:
- **Special symbols found**: 11 ✓
- **Pattern examples**: Limited examples found
- **Wildcard notation**: Not captured ❌

**Gap**: Got some symbols but missed the actual pattern language syntax.

## 4. Algorithm Details

### Expected:
- **α-Stage Algorithm**:
  - 15 features selected
  - Random Forest classifier
  - Genetic Algorithm feature selection
  - ~94% accuracy
- **β-Stage Algorithm** (Algorithm 1):
  - ApplyPattern function
  - Wildcard inference
  - Scoring function h(edge)

### Multi-Pass Results:
- **Algorithms found**: 4 ✓
  - Hyperedge Type Inference
  - Concept Hypernym Identification
  - Predicate Argument-Role Annotation
  - (One more not listed)
- **Implementation notes**: Yes ✓
- **Feature engineering details**: Not captured ❌
- **Specific accuracy numbers**: Not in algorithms section

**Gap**: Found some algorithms but missed the specific α and β stage details.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

### Expected:
- **Specific accuracy numbers**:
  - Reddit: 96.0%
  - Blog: 93.6%
  - News: 94.1%
- **OIE Benchmark comparisons**: ReVerb, OLLIE, ClausIE
- **Conjunction Decomposition**: 72.5% F1

### Multi-Pass Results:
- **Metrics found**: 2 (accuracy, p-value) ✓
- **Benchmarks found**: 3 (spaCy POS/dependency) ✓
- **Specific numbers**: 
  - POS: 97% ✓
  - Unlabeled dependency: 92% ✓
  - Labeled dependency: 90% ✓
- **Statistical tests**: 2 found ✓

**Gap**: Found spaCy benchmarks but missed the text category performance and OIE benchmarks.

## 6. Complete Examples

### Expected:
- **Full parsing traces** with step-by-step transformations
- **Application examples**: taxonomy inference, coreference, conflict detection

### Multi-Pass Results:
- **Examples found**: 1 ("Berlin is very nice") ✓
- **Walkthroughs**: 1 ✓
- **Application examples**: Not captured ❌

**Gap**: Got the basic example but missed the rich application examples.

## Summary

### What Multi-Pass Captured Well:
1. ✓ Algorithms (4 found)
2. ✓ Some evaluation metrics and benchmarks
3. ✓ Basic examples
4. ✓ Special symbols (11 found)
5. ✓ Formal definitions and constraints

### Critical Gaps:
1. ❌ **Tables 1, 2, 3**: The core type codes, inference rules, and argument roles
2. ❌ **Pattern language syntax**: Wildcards and matching rules
3. ❌ **α and β stage specifics**: ML details and parsing algorithm
4. ❌ **Application patterns**: OIE, conflict detection patterns

### Why the Gaps?
The O3 model seems to be:
1. Not recognizing plain-text tables in the paper format
2. Looking for JSON-like structures instead of academic paper tables
3. Missing content that appears as formatted text rather than explicit sections

### Recommendation:
The multi-pass extractor needs:
1. **Better table detection**: Look for patterns like "Table 1:" followed by formatted data
2. **Type code recognition**: Search for patterns like "C concept", "P predicate"
3. **Multiple text windows**: Tables might be split across our text boundaries
4. **Pattern-specific prompts**: Dedicated passes for tables vs algorithms vs examples
