THEORY COUNT DETECTION PROMPT - Version 1

You are analyzing an academic paper to determine how many distinct theories it contains. Your task is to identify whether this paper presents a single unified theory, multiple separate theories, or integrates existing theories into a new framework.

ANALYSIS CRITERIA:

SINGLE THEORY indicators:
- Proposes one unified theoretical model or framework
- All concepts serve the same coherent theoretical purpose
- Consistent terminology and definitions throughout
- Single set of hypotheses, predictions, or propositions
- Coherent explanatory mechanism or process
- Example: "We propose a new theory of X that explains Y through mechanism Z"

MULTIPLE THEORIES indicators:
- Compares or contrasts different theoretical approaches
- Reviews literature presenting distinct theoretical frameworks
- Contains "Theory A vs Theory B" or "Approach X vs Approach Y" language
- Presents conflicting or alternative explanations for same phenomena
- Different terminology systems used for similar concepts
- Historical progression through multiple theoretical developments
- Literature review covering multiple theoretical perspectives
- Example: "Previous research has proposed three main theories: X theory (Smith, 1990), Y theory (Jones, 1995), and Z theory (Brown, 2000)"

THEORY INTEGRATION indicators:
- Explicitly combines or synthesizes previous theories
- Uses language like "building on X and Y" or "integrating A and B"
- Presents unified framework incorporating multiple previous approaches
- Extends existing theories with new components or mechanisms
- Example: "We integrate social identity theory and cognitive dissonance theory to create a unified framework"

REVIEW/SURVEY indicators:
- Comprehensive review of theoretical developments in a field
- Meta-analysis of multiple theoretical approaches
- Survey of competing theoretical explanations
- Comparative analysis of theoretical frameworks
- Example: "This paper reviews 20 years of theoretical development in field X"

      section: "Where discussed in paper"

    - name: "Base Theory 2"

IMPORTANT: Focus on theoretical content, not methodological discussions. A paper that reviews methods is not necessarily reviewing multiple theories.
