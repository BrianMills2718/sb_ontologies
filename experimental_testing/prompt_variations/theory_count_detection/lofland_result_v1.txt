==================================================

theory_count: single

relationships_between_theories: extension

confidence: high

reasoning: This paper develops one unified "value-added" model of conversion, laying out a sequential set of seven necessary (and jointly sufficient) conditions that explain the process of conversion to a deviant perspective. It does not compare multiple separate theories, review a range of theoretical approaches, or synthesize distinct theories into a new framework. All components serve a coherent explanatory purpose in one integrated model, indicating a single unified theoretical approach.
