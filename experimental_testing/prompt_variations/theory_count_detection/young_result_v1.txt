==================================================

theory_count: integration

base_theories:
  - name: "Cognitive Mapping"
    source: "Axelrod, Bonham, Shapiro, and others (1970s)"
  - name: "Semantic Networks"
    source: "Ross Quillian (1968) and related work"

integration_type: combination

new_framework_name: "WorldView"

relationships_between_theories: synthesis

confidence: high

reasoning: "The paper does not introduce multiple conflicting theories or just a single theory; instead, it integrates two established approaches—cognitive mapping and semantic networks—into a new, unified framework called WorldView. The author builds on earlier methods in cognitive mapping and enhances them by incorporating symbolic, relation-differentiated features of semantic networks, providing a combined and enriched approach to representing belief structures and decision processes."
