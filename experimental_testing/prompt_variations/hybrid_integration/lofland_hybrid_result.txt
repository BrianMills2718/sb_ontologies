HYBRID THEORY DETECTION TEST
Input: validation_results/complexity_testing/lofland_stark_simple_theory.txt
==================================================

hybrid_detected: false
confidence: 0.9
primary_components:
  - component_name: "Sequential Funnel Structure"
    model_type: "sequence"
    evidence: "The theory organizes seven necessary conditions in a specific order (a funnel) through which potential converts are progressively filtered."
    theoretical_role: "It outlines a stepwise process leading to conversion, with each condition building sequentially on the previous one."
integration_mechanisms:
  - "Although the theory distinguishes between different conditions and even conversion types (verbal versus total), they are integrated solely via their sequential interdependence rather than through multiple, fundamentally different representational paradigms."
integration_type: layered
unified_framework_name: "Value-Added Sequential Conversion Model"
alternative_single_model: "Yes â€“ the entire theory is adequately captured using a single sequential process model rather than requiring multiple structural or representational modalities."
