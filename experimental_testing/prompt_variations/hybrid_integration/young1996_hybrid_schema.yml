  title: "WorldView Cognitive Mapping and Semantic Network Framework"
  description: "A comprehensive framework that unifies quantitative cognitive mapping with qualitative semantic network representations. This hybrid model leverages structured adjacency matrices to quantify belief structures while incorporating symbolic, property-rich nodes and edges to capture nuanced relationships, modifiers, and truth assessments essential for understanding complex decision-making processes."
  
  components:
    Cognitive Mapping:
      model_type: "table_matrix"
      root_properties:
        - "Adjacency Matrix Representation: A square matrix with rows and columns representing concepts."
        - "Structural Measures: Dependency, Connectedness, Size, Uniformity of Salience calculated from relationships."
      definitions:
        concept: "A fundamental unit representing a belief or idea, numerically indexed in the matrix."
        relationship: "A numeric indicator (1 or 0) denoting the presence or absence of a causal link between concepts."
    
    Semantic Networks:
      model_type: "property_graph"
      root_properties:
        - "Node-based Representation: Every concept and relationship is a node with attached properties."
        - "Attributes: Truth-values, Modifiers (past, present, future, hypothetical, normative), and Salience for each relationship."
      definitions:
        node: "An entity representing a concept or relationship, capable of holding symbolic information."
        edge: "A connection between nodes that carries specific semantic properties such as type, conditionality, and strength."
