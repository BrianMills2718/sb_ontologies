HYBRID THEORY DETECTION PROMPT

You are analyzing a theory to determine if it requires HYBRID representation - meaning it fundamentally integrates multiple structural paradigms that cannot be captured by a single model type.

HYBRID THEORY INDICATORS:

MULTIPLE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS:
- Theory explicitly combines different representational approaches
- Different aspects require different structural representations
- Theory integrates previously separate paradigms
- Multiple model types needed to capture full theoretical complexity

STRUCTURAL INTEGRATION LANGUAGE:
- "Combines X with Y", "integrates A and B", "merges C and D"
- "Building on both X and Y approaches"
- "Synthesizes network/table/sequence structures"
- "Multi-level model", "multi-component framework"

CROSS-PARADIGM VOCABULARY:
- Network terms + experimental terms + sequential terms
- Statistical parameters + logical axioms + causal graphs
- Matrix representations + graph structures + process flows
- Quantitative + qualitative + structural elements

EXPLICIT MULTI-COMPONENT DESIGN:
- Different theory sections require different representations
- Component A (network) + Component B (table) + Component C (sequence)
- Methodological integration of multiple approaches
- Systematic combination of different model types

INTEGRATION MAPPINGS:
- How components interact or connect
- Cross-component relationships specified
- Integration mechanisms described
- Unified framework spanning multiple paradigms

EXAMPLES OF HYBRID THEORIES:
- Cognitive mapping + semantic networks + matrix mathematics
- Social network analysis + experimental design + temporal sequences
- Game theory matrices + causal graphs + statistical models
- Property graphs + classification tables + process flows

NON-HYBRID INDICATORS (SINGLE PARADIGM):
- Single clear structural focus
- Consistent model type throughout
- No explicit paradigm integration
- Single representational approach adequate

OUTPUT FORMAT:
hybrid_detected: [true|false]
confidence: [0.0 to 1.0]
primary_components:
  - component_name: "Component 1 Name"
    model_type: "table_matrix|property_graph|sequence|statistical|logical"
    evidence: "Evidence for this component"
    theoretical_role: "What this component contributes"
  - component_name: "Component 2 Name"
    model_type: "table_matrix|property_graph|sequence|statistical|logical"
    evidence: "Evidence for this component"
    theoretical_role: "What this component contributes"
integration_mechanisms:
  - "How components connect or interact"
  - "Cross-component relationships"
integration_type: [synthesis|combination|extension|layered]
unified_framework_name: "Name of integrated theory if applicable"
alternative_single_model: "Could this be captured by single model type instead?"

CRITICAL: Only detect hybrid when multiple paradigms are NECESSARY. Many theories mention multiple concepts but have single structural focus.
