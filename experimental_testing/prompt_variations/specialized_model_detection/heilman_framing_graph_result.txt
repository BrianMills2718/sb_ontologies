==================================================

detection_confidence: 0.95  
structure_type: "property_graph"  
evidence:
  - "The theory is built on multiple interrelated concepts such as Decision Maker, Decisional Alternative, Frame, Reference Point, Risk Preference, and Loss Aversion."
  - "It exhibits semantic relationships (e.g., framing effects modifying risk preferences) and causal links (e.g., how framing causes preference reversals) which are typical of rich network structures."  
extracted_structure:
  node_types: ["Theoretical Construct", "Decision Component", "Cognitive Bias", "Outcome Evaluator", "Experimental Paradigm"]
  relationship_types: ["influences", "contradicts", "explains", "correlates with", "violates"]
  key_nodes: ["Framing Effect", "Decision Maker", "Prospect Theory", "Risk Preference", "Reference Point"]
  relationship_richness: "Multiple layers of relationships are present: conceptual relationships (e.g., invariance violation relates to economic rationality), causal dependencies (e.g., framing causing risk behavior shifts), and evaluative contrasts (e.g., loss aversion vs. gain evaluation)."
network_characteristics: "The theory is organized as a network because it emphasizes connections among various conceptual nodes with labeled, directional interrelations—ranging from causal dependencies to conceptual hierarchies—demonstrating emergent properties typical of a property graph rather than a simple tabular or sequential format."
alternative_representations: "While aspects of the theory could be abstracted into a table or a sequence (e.g., listing components and their definitions), such representations would lose the intricate interdependencies and multi-typed relationships that define its network structure."
