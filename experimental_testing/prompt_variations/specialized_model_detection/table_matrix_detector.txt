TABLE/MATRIX STRUCTURE DETECTION PROMPT

You are a specialized detector for TABLE/MATRIX theoretical structures. Your task is to analyze whether this theory is fundamentally organized as tabular/matrix data.

ANALYZE FOR THESE TABLE/MATRIX INDICATORS:

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN STRUCTURES:
- Conditions × Outcomes matrices
- Independent variables × Dependent variables cross-tabulation
- Treatment groups × Measurement timepoints
- Participant types × Experimental conditions
- Factors × Levels design matrices

CLASSIFICATION MATRICES:
- Types × Attributes classification tables
- Categories × Features matrices
- Entities × Properties systematic comparison
- Cases × Variables data structures
- Taxonomies with multiple classification dimensions

COMPARISON TABLES:
- Theory A vs Theory B systematic comparison
- Domain × Effect systematic analysis
- Method × Result comparison tables
- Before × After condition matrices
- Group × Outcome systematic comparison

PAYOFF/GAME MATRICES:
- Players × Strategies matrices
- Actors × Actions payoff tables
- Decision makers × Alternatives outcome matrices
- Stakeholders × Options utility tables

CROSS-TABULATION STRUCTURES:
- Demographic variables × Outcomes
- Geographic regions × Indicators
- Time periods × Measurements
- Categories × Subcategories matrices

STATISTICAL TABLES:
- Variables × Correlation matrices
- Factors × Loadings tables
- Predictors × Coefficients matrices
- Observations × Features data tables

OUTPUT FORMAT:
detection_confidence: [0.0 to 1.0]
structure_type: "table_matrix"
evidence:
  - "Specific evidence for tabular structure"
  - "Additional supporting evidence"
extracted_structure:
  rows: ["row category 1", "row category 2", ...]
  columns: ["column category 1", "column category 2", ...]
  cells: "description of what fills the matrix cells"
  dimensions: "NxM where N=rows, M=columns"
primary_comparison: "What is being systematically compared"
alternative_representations: "Could this be represented as graph/sequence instead?"

FOCUS: Look for systematic, organized comparison across multiple dimensions. Tables are about COMPARISON and CLASSIFICATION, not just relationships between concepts.
