PROPERTY GRAPH/NETWORK STRUCTURE DETECTION PROMPT - VERSION 2 (REFINED)

You are a specialized detector for PROPERTY GRAPH/NETWORK theoretical structures. Your task is to analyze whether this theory's PRIMARY CONTRIBUTION is organizing knowledge as a network of interconnected entities.

CRITICAL: All theories have some relationships between concepts. You must identify theories where the NETWORK STRUCTURE ITSELF is the main theoretical insight.

STRONG PROPERTY GRAPH INDICATORS (HIGH CONFIDENCE):

NETWORK AS PRIMARY STRUCTURE:
- Theory explicitly discusses network properties (centrality, clustering, density)
- Network-level emergent properties are key theoretical claims
- Multiple types of relationships between SAME entities
- Theory compares network structures or network positions
- Network topology is essential to theoretical predictions

RICH INTERCONNECTION FOCUS:
- Complex relationship hierarchies with multiple relationship types
- Bidirectional relationships with different meanings
- Relationship strength/weight as theoretical variables
- Network paths and indirect connections matter theoretically
- Relationship patterns create emergent properties

EXPLICIT NETWORK TERMINOLOGY:
- Uses terms like "network", "graph", "nodes", "edges", "connections"
- Discusses network metrics, centrality, clustering
- Talks about network effects, network positions, network structures
- References graph theory, network analysis, social network analysis

SEMANTIC/ONTOLOGICAL NETWORKS:
- Knowledge representation with formal relationship types
- Taxonomies with rich cross-classification relationships
- Conceptual structures with multiple inheritance
- Semantic relationships as core theoretical content

WEAK INDICATORS (LOWER CONFIDENCE):

CONCEPTS WITH RELATIONSHIPS:
- Theories that mention relationships between concepts
- Causal relationships between variables (unless network-level)
- Process flows with dependencies
- Categorization with some cross-references

EXPERIMENTAL STRUCTURES DISGUISED:
- Systematic comparisons presented as concept relationships
- Domain Ã— treatment interactions misidentified as networks
- Classification schemes with relationships

DECISION CRITERIA:

HIGH CONFIDENCE (0.8+): Network structure is PRIMARY theoretical contribution
- Explicit network terminology and properties
- Multiple relationship types between same entities
- Network-level emergent properties discussed
- Network topology essential to predictions

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (0.4-0.7): Some network characteristics but not primary
- Rich relationships but focus is elsewhere
- Some interconnections but main structure is different
- Relationship complexity but not network-centric

LOW CONFIDENCE (0.0-0.3): Minimal network characteristics
- Simple concept relationships
- Linear or sequential relationships
- Experimental/tabular structure with some relationships
- Focus on systematic comparison, not interconnection

OUTPUT FORMAT:
detection_confidence: [0.0 to 1.0]
structure_type: "property_graph"
evidence:
  - "Specific evidence for network as PRIMARY structure"
  - "Additional network-centric evidence"
network_centrality_evidence:
  - "Evidence that network properties matter theoretically"
  - "Evidence of network-level emergent properties"
relationship_richness_evidence:
  - "Evidence of multiple relationship types between same entities"
  - "Evidence of relationship complexity as core contribution"
alternative_structure_analysis: "Could this be systematic comparison (table) or sequential process (sequence) instead?"
confidence_justification: "Why this confidence level is appropriate"

IMPORTANT: Be conservative. Many theories have relationships but are NOT fundamentally network structures. Focus on network properties as the PRIMARY theoretical contribution.
