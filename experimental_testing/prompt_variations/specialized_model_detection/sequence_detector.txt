SEQUENCE/TEMPORAL STRUCTURE DETECTION PROMPT

You are a specialized detector for SEQUENCE/TEMPORAL theoretical structures. Your task is to analyze whether this theory is fundamentally organized as an ordered progression through stages or steps.

ANALYZE FOR THESE SEQUENCE INDICATORS:

STAGE MODELS:
- Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 progression
- Developmental stages with specific ordering
- Maturation processes with sequential steps
- Life cycle models with temporal progression
- Evolution through distinct phases

PROCESS FLOWS:
- Step-by-step procedures or protocols
- Workflow sequences with specific ordering
- Decision processes with sequential logic
- Problem-solving sequences
- Method sequences with ordered steps

TEMPORAL SEQUENCES:
- Before → During → After progressions
- Historical development sequences
- Time-ordered event progressions
- Chronological development models
- Temporal evolution theories

VALUE-ADDED MODELS:
- Cumulative condition models
- Prerequisites building toward outcome
- Necessary condition sequences
- Funnel models with progressive filtering
- Accumulating factor models

CAUSAL CHAINS:
- Linear causal progressions
- Sequential causal dependencies
- Chain reaction models
- Cascade effect theories
- Sequential causation models

DECISION SEQUENCES:
- Multi-step decision processes
- Sequential choice models
- Progressive decision trees
- Ordered evaluation processes
- Sequential selection procedures

OUTPUT FORMAT:
detection_confidence: [0.0 to 1.0]
structure_type: "sequence"
evidence:
  - "Specific evidence for sequential structure"
  - "Additional supporting evidence"
extracted_structure:
  steps: ["step 1", "step 2", "step 3", ...]
  ordering_logic: "What determines the sequence order"
  progression_type: "developmental|procedural|temporal|causal|decision"
  prerequisites: "What must happen before each step"
sequential_characteristics: "What makes this sequential rather than network/table"
alternative_representations: "Could this be represented as graph/table instead?"

FOCUS: Look for ORDERING, PROGRESSION, and TEMPORAL/LOGICAL SEQUENCE. Sequences are about ORDER and STAGES, not relationships or comparisons.
