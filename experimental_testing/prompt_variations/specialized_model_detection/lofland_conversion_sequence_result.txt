==================================================

detection_confidence: 1.0
structure_type: "sequence"
evidence:
  - "The theory explicitly outlines a series of seven successively accumulating factors (or stages) that must be met for conversion."
  - "The sequential arrangement is described as a funnel, with each condition narrowing the range of potential converts, indicating an ordered progression."
extracted_structure:
  steps: [
    "Tension",
    "Religious Problem-Solving Perspective",
    "Seekership",
    "Turning Point",
    "Affective Bonds",
    "Neutralization of Extra-Cult Attachments",
    "Intensive Interaction"
  ]
  ordering_logic: "Each condition builds on its predecessor in an accumulating, necessary series, forming a funnel that progressively reduces the pool of potential converts. The activation of each condition is sequentially ordered based on their role in conversion, even if their temporal occurrence can vary."
  progression_type: "value-added|procedural"
  prerequisites: "Each step requires the necessary emotional or cognitive state established by the preceding condition; for example, a religious problem-solving perspective must preexist before seekership can occur, and intensive interaction is needed after the establishment of all previous bonds and conditions."
sequential_characteristics: "The theory is sequential because it posits that the cumulative, step-by-step addition of conditions is necessary for conversion. This ordered progression is based on logical activation and a funnel-like narrowing, rather than a network of interrelated factors or a simple comparative structure."
alternative_representations: "While the structure is clearly sequential, it could also be represented as a funnel diagram or a flowchart to visualize the ordered stages and the narrowing process; however, a table may not adequately capture the dynamic, progressive filtering process inherent in the model."
