==================================================

detection_confidence: 0.9
structure_type: "property_graph"
evidence:
  - "The theory explicitly re-conceptualizes cognitive maps as semantic networks, where concepts and relationships are represented as nodes, clearly signaling a network representation."
  - "It details how relationships (multiple types such as causal, attribute, goal, and more) are elevated to node status, emphasizing a network structure rather than simple linear associations."
network_centrality_evidence:
  - "The development of measures such as dependency and connectedness demonstrates an emphasis on network properties and topology to understand belief structures."
  - "The discussion of network-level emergent properties (e.g., transformation cost, uniformity of salience) shows that the structure of the network is central to theoretical predictions."
relationship_richness_evidence:
  - "The theory distinguishes between multiple relationship types (e.g., positive-cause, negative-cause, attribute, is-a, condition) among the same set of concepts, highlighting rich interconnectivity."
  - "The method’s capacity to handle compound statements by representing relationships as nodes underscores that relationship complexity is a core theoretical contribution."
alternative_structure_analysis: "The structure is not merely a sequential process or a tabular comparison; it fundamentally relies on a network (graph) topology to represent and analyze interconnected beliefs."
confidence_justification: "The theory’s primary innovation lies in its explicit use of semantic network models to represent complex cognitive maps, incorporating diverse relationship types and network measures. This network-centric approach is a fundamental shift from traditional, linear cognitive mapping, justifying the high confidence level."
