detection_confidence: 0.8
structure_type: "sequence"
evidence:
  - "The method is described in terms of a defined, step‐by‐step process – for example, first performing a human-coded content analysis to identify beliefs, then compiling these into nodes, and finally generating and manipulating a cognitive map."
  - "The directed‑walk reasoning model is explicitly described as a sequential procedure (steps 1 through 8) that selects, activates, and processes the most salient propositions."
extracted_structure:
  steps: [
    "Conduct human-coded content analysis to extract subject‑relationship‑object statements from texts",
    "Identify and code belief elements and the various types of relationships (causal, attribute, etc.) with associated truth‑values and modifiers",
    "Aggregate the coded data into nodes representing concepts, relationships, and conjunctions",
    "Compile the individual data statements into a manipulable cognitive map using a computer program",
    "Apply structural measures and process models (e.g., transformation cost, directed‑walk) to capture changes and reasoning flows"
