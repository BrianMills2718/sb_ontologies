# Specialized Model Type Detection Results

## Test Results Summary

### Heilman Framing Effects Theory (Known: Should be TABLE_MATRIX)

| Detector | Confidence | Correct? | Key Insights |
|----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Table Matrix** | 0.3 | ✅ **CORRECT** | Identified 2×2 structure (gain/loss × sure/probabilistic) |
| **Property Graph** | 0.95 | ❌ **WRONG** | Over-confident due to seeing concept relationships |
| **Sequence** | 0.1 | ✅ **CORRECT** | Correctly rejected sequential structure |

**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**: Property graph detector is over-confident and biased. It sees relationships between concepts and assumes that means network structure, missing that the fundamental theoretical contribution is experimental comparison.

**SOLUTION NEEDED**: Property graph detector needs refinement to distinguish between "theories that have relationships" vs "theories whose primary structure IS the network of relationships".

### Lofland-Stark Conversion Theory (Known: Should be SEQUENCE)

| Detector | Confidence | Correct? | Key Insights |
|----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Sequence** | 1.0 | ✅ **PERFECT** | Perfectly identified 7-step value-added model |
| **Property Graph** | 0.85 | ❌ **WRONG** | Saw relationships but missed sequential core |
| **Table Matrix** | 0.1 | ✅ **CORRECT** | Correctly rejected tabular structure |

**SUCCESS**: Sequence detector working perfectly. Table detector correctly rejecting. Property graph still over-confident but better than Heilman case.

## Key Findings

### 1. Property Graph Bias Confirmed and Quantified

**Problem**: Property graph detector shows systematic over-confidence (0.95, 0.85) when other structures are more appropriate.

**Root Cause**: The detector is looking for "relationships between concepts" but ALL theories have concept relationships. The key distinction is whether the STRUCTURE itself is the network.

**Fix Needed**: Refine property graph detector to focus on:
- Network-level properties (centrality, clustering, etc.)
- Multiple relationship types between same entities
- Rich interconnections as the PRIMARY theoretical contribution
- NOT just presence of relationships

### 2. Specialized Detectors Show Promise

**Table Matrix Detector**: 
- ✅ Correctly identified experimental structure in Heilman (0.3)
- ✅ Correctly rejected sequential structure in Lofland (0.1)
- **Issue**: Low confidence even when correct - needs calibration

**Sequence Detector**:
- ✅ Perfect performance on Lofland (1.0)
- ✅ Correctly rejected framing theory (0.1)
- **Status**: Working excellently

### 3. Confidence Integration Strategy

Based on results, optimal decision rule:

```python
def select_model_type(table_conf, graph_conf, sequence_conf):
    # Sequence detector is most reliable
    if sequence_conf >= 0.8:
        return "sequence"
    
    # Table detector, even at low confidence, beats property graph
    elif table_conf >= 0.3 and table_conf > graph_conf:
        return "table_matrix"
    
    # Property graph only if others are very low
    elif graph_conf > 0.9 and table_conf < 0.2 and sequence_conf < 0.2:
        return "property_graph"
    
    # Default to highest confidence but flag for review
    else:
        return max(table_conf, graph_conf, sequence_conf) + "_FLAG_FOR_REVIEW"
```

## Required Improvements

### Priority 1: Fix Property Graph Over-Confidence

**Current Problem**: Detects relationships → assumes network structure
**Solution**: Add filtering criteria:
- Require network-level properties mentioned
- Require multiple relationship types between same entities
- Require centrality/clustering concepts
- Require interconnection richness as primary contribution

### Priority 2: Calibrate Table Matrix Confidence

**Current Problem**: Correct identification but low confidence (0.3)
**Solution**: Lower threshold for systematic comparison detection
- Better recognition of experimental designs
- Domain × treatment comparisons
- Cross-tabulation language patterns

### Priority 3: Test on More Cases

**Need to test**:
- Young 1996 (integration case - cognitive mapping + semantic networks)
- Complex hybrid theories
- Statistical model theories
- Pure network theories (to validate property graph detector)

## Next Steps

1. **Refine Property Graph Detector** - Add network-specific criteria
2. **Test Refined Detectors** - Validate improvements
3. **Build Confidence Integration** - Implement decision rules
4. **Test on Remaining Cases** - Complete validation
5. **Architecture Comparison** - Sequential vs parallel processing

## Success Metrics

- **Model Type Accuracy**: Current 50% (1/2 correct primary selection) → Target 90%
- **Confidence Calibration**: Correct detectors should have higher confidence
- **Bias Reduction**: Property graph over-confidence needs elimination

**Current Status**: Specialized detection shows promise but requires refinement before deployment.
