# Fix for Information Loss Between Phases

## Problem
Phase 3 doesn't receive the complete Phase 1 vocabulary, causing terms to be lost.

## Current Flow:
Phase 1 (61 terms) → Phase 2 (classification) → Phase 3 (only sees Phase 2 summary)

## Solution:
Pass the FULL Phase 1 vocabulary to Phase 3, not just Phase 2's classification.

## Implementation:
In `multiphase_processor_improved.py`, modify `generate_schema()` to include:

```python
# Current prompt only includes Phase 2 summary
prompt = f"Classification: {phase2_result}..."

# Should be:
prompt = f"""
FULL VOCABULARY FROM PHASE 1:
{json.dumps(phase1_result.vocabulary, indent=2)}

PHASE 2 CLASSIFICATION:
{phase2_result}

Generate schema ensuring ALL Phase 1 terms are included...
"""
```

This ensures Phase 3 sees all 61 original terms and can't miss any.
