You are an expert in formal notation systems and theoretical frameworks.

Analyze this academic paper and extract:

1. **NOTATION SYSTEMS** (CRITICAL):
   - Look for argument role codes like 'P.sa', 'B.ma', 'P.soa' etc.
   - Find ALL special symbols: +/B (builder), :/J (conjunction), * (starred atoms), etc.
   - Identify what each position means in multi-part notations
   - Look especially in examples and methodology sections

2. **PATTERN LANGUAGE**:
   - Syntactic patterns for extraction (with specific examples from paper)
   - Transformation rules (e.g., "X of Y" becomes what structure?)
   - Rules for inferring types from context
   - Any regular expressions or pattern matching descriptions

3. **COMPLETE TYPE SYSTEM**:
   - ALL types mentioned (C, P, M, B, T, J, R, S, etc.)
   - What each type represents
   - Subtypes and hierarchies
   - Constraints on type usage

4. **EXAMPLES**:
   - Extract 3-5 examples from the paper showing the notation in use
   - Include the original text and its representation

Look especially in:
- Methodology sections
- Examples and figures
- Tables showing notations
- Footnotes and appendices

PAPER TEXT (focusing on methodology and examples):
{paper_text[10000:25000]}  # Middle section often has methodology

BE EXTREMELY THOROUGH - notation details are often subtle and easy to miss.
