You are an expert in schema design for knowledge representation.

Given the classified vocabulary from an academic theory, design a comprehensive schema that:

1. **Selects the optimal model type** based on the theory's actual structure:
   - property_graph: Rich relationships between diverse entities
   - hypergraph: N-ary relationships where edges connect multiple vertices, recursive/nested structures
   - table_matrix: Structured classifications or typologies
   - sequence: Ordered processes or stages
   - tree: Hierarchical taxonomies or decision trees
   - timeline: Temporal evolution or historical development
   - other: Unique structures requiring custom representation

2. **Considers hypergraph indicators**:
   - Relationships involving 3+ participants (n-ary relations)
   - Recursive or nested relationship structures
   - Ordered sequences of participants in relationships
   - Relations that reference other relations
   - Hyperedges as first-class objects with properties

3. **Designs comprehensive node types** with:
   - Specific node types matching the theory's entities
   - All relevant properties for each node type
   - Hierarchical subtypes where applicable
   - Semantic constraints

4. **Defines precise edge types** with:
   - Specific from/to type constraints (not generic)
   - Edge properties where applicable
   - Inverse relationships where relevant
   - For hypergraphs: participant roles and ordering

5. **Includes all supporting elements**:
   - Complete property definitions
   - Modifiers (temporal/modal) used in the theory
   - Truth value system if applicable
   - Logical operators if used

6. **Adapts to the specific theory**:
   - Title should reference the theory name
   - Description should explain the theory's focus
   - Structure should match the theory's conceptual model

7. **CRITICAL - Extracts notation systems**:
   - Argument role codes (e.g., P.sa for predicate with subject-argument roles)
   - Special symbols and operators (e.g., +/B for builder, :/J for conjunction)
   - Position-based meanings in notations
   - Abbreviated forms and their expansions

8. **CRITICAL - Documents extraction patterns**:
   - Pattern matching rules or regular expressions used by the theory
   - Transformation rules (e.g., "X of Y" â†’ predicate(Y,X))
   - Type inference rules from context
   - Syntactic patterns for identifying structures

9. **Includes implementation details**:
   - Step-by-step algorithms if provided
   - Edge cases and exceptions
   - Validation constraints and rules
   - Ordering requirements for arguments

Do not default to property_graph - genuinely evaluate which model type best represents this specific theory. Pay special attention to n-ary relationships and recursive structures that may indicate a hypergraph representation.

IMPORTANT: Look for any notation systems, symbolic representations, or pattern languages that the theory uses for extraction or representation. These are often found in methodology sections or examples.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You will receive the COMPLETE Phase 1 vocabulary. Your schema MUST include ALL terms from this vocabulary - do not omit any terms. If a term appears in Phase 1, it must appear in your final schema definitions.
