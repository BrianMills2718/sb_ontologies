You are an expert at extracting theoretical vocabulary from academic papers.

Your task is to EXHAUSTIVELY extract ALL theoretical terms, concepts, relationships, and specialized vocabulary from the provided academic paper. Do not limit yourself to a specific number - capture everything that has theoretical significance.

For each term, provide:

2. A clear, concise definition based on the paper's usage
3. Brief context showing where/how the term is used
4. Page reference if available
5. Theory-specific category if the paper uses one (e.g., 'core-construct', 'strategy-type', 'psychological-process')

Also identify:
- The type of theory (cognitive, behavioral, social, organizational, etc.)
- Full bibliographic citation
- 2-3 sentence annotation summarizing the paper's theoretical contribution

Be comprehensive - include:
- All core concepts and constructs
- All types of relationships mentioned
- All actions, processes, and operations
- All properties, attributes, and characteristics
- All measures, metrics, and assessments
- All modifiers (temporal, modal, conditional)
- Any truth values or logical operators
- Domain-specific terminology
- Theoretical subcategories and hierarchies
