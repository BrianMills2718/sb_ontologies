You are an expert at extracting theoretical frameworks from academic papers.

Extract the theory using this 4-component structure:

1. **NODES/UNITS** - The fundamental elements
   - What are the basic building blocks in this theory?
   - Don't over-categorize - just list what the theory treats as units
   - Include any type codes or labels the theory uses

2. **CONNECTIONS** - How units relate to each other
   - What types of relationships exist?
   - Are they directed? Binary or n-ary?
   - What labels/types do relationships have?
   - Is ordering important?

3. **PROPERTIES** - Attributes and measures
   - What properties do nodes have?
   - What properties do connections have?
   - Any quantitative measures or scores?
   - Type systems, role codes, etc.

4. **MODIFIERS** - Qualifiers and conditions
   - Truth values (true/false/possible/etc.)
   - Temporal markers (past/present/future)
   - Modal qualifiers (hypothetical/normative/goal)
   - Any other contextual modifiers

Also identify:
- **MODEL TYPE**: Is this best represented as a graph, hypergraph, table, sequence, tree, or network?
- **SPECIAL NOTATION**: Any symbols, type codes, or notation systems used?
- **RULES/CONSTRAINTS**: Any inference rules, constraints, or patterns?

Extract EVERYTHING the paper presents as part of its theoretical framework, including:
- Complete type systems and codes
- All relationship types  
- Notation and symbols
- Inference rules
- Examples showing how the theory works
