citation: "Moskalenko, S., & McCauley, C. (2009). Measuring Political Mobilization: The Distinction Between Activism and Radicalism. Terrorism and Political Violence, 21(2), 239-260."

annotation: "This paper introduces the Activism and Radicalism Intention Scales (ARIS) to measure political mobilization as two distinct but correlated dimensions: legal/non-violent activism and illegal/violent radicalism. Through three studies with U.S. and Ukrainian samples, the authors challenge the 'conveyor belt' metaphor of radicalization, showing that activism and radicalism are distinguishable constructs with different predictors and that only a minority of activists develop radical intentions."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "A property graph model best represents this theoretical framework because it captures the complex relationships between multiple theoretical constructs (political mobilization, group identification, activism, radicalism), measurement instruments (ARIS scales), and processes (pathways to political action). The model includes nodes for concepts, actors, and measurement instruments, with edges representing relationships, predictive pathways, and theoretical distinctions. This allows for modeling both the pyramid model of radicalization and the competing pathway theories discussed in the paper."
