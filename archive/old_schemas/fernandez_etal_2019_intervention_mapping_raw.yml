annotation: "Intervention Mapping (IM) is a systematic, theory- and evidence-based framework for health promotion program planning that provides a step-by-step protocol for intervention development, implementation, and evaluation. The framework incorporates participatory planning, eclectic use of theory, and ecological/systems approaches to address health problems at multiple levels through community-based participatory research methods."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The Intervention Mapping framework is best represented as a property graph model because it describes a complex system of interconnected processes, stakeholders, determinants, methods, and outcomes. The framework involves relationships between multiple entities (behaviors, environmental conditions, determinants, methods, applications, stakeholders) that form a network of causal and procedural connections across six sequential but iterative steps."
