annotation: "Comprehensive review of the reasoned action approach to understanding health message effects, tracing the theory's evolution from 1960s attitude-behavior research through four major formulations (theory of reasoned action, theory of planned behavior, integrative model, and current reasoned action approach) and explaining how the theory identifies optimal message content through belief-based behavioral processes."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The reasoned action approach represents a complex theoretical framework with multiple interconnected constructs, processes, and relationships. A property graph model best captures the hierarchical relationships between beliefs, attitudes, norms, control perceptions, intentions, and behaviors, as well as the feedback loops and moderating factors. The theory's emphasis on belief-based processes and the systematic relationships between psychological variables makes it ideal for network representation."
