annotation: "Comprehensive review of attitude research (2010-2017) examining how attitudes form and change within personal, social, and sociohistorical contexts. Introduces holistic contextualism as the new zeitgeist, moving beyond microprocesses to understand attitudes as embedded in values, goals, emotions, cultural frameworks, and developmental patterns."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "Property graph model captures the complex theoretical network of attitudes research, representing attitudes as central nodes connected to multiple contextual influences (personal, social, historical), measurement approaches (explicit/implicit), change processes (persuasion, development), and cultural variations. The interconnected nature of attitude formation, change mechanisms, and behavioral outcomes requires a graph structure to model the relationships between constructs, processes, and contexts."
