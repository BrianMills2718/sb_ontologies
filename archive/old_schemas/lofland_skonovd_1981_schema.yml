annotation: "This foundational work identifies six distinct conversion motifs based on five major variations: intellectual, mystical, experimental, affectional, revivalist, and coercive. Each motif represents a qualitatively different pattern of religious transformation characterized by varying degrees of social pressure, temporal duration, affective arousal, emotional content, and belief-participation sequences."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The property graph model best captures the complex relational structure of conversion motifs theory, where conversion experiences (nodes) are connected to social psychological processes, organizational contexts, and temporal sequences (edges). The six motifs form a structured typology with systematic relationships between characteristics, social conditions, and conversion outcomes that can be effectively represented as interconnected entities and processes."
