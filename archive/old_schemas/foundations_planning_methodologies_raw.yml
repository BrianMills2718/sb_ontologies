annotation: "A comprehensive review of four planning methodologies for influence operations: Strategies-to-Tasks (STT), Effects-Based Operations (EBOs), Assumption-Based Planning (ABP), and Capabilities-Based Planning (CBP). The paper analyzes their applicability, strengths, and limitations for planning influence operations across different phases of conflict and organizational levels."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The paper presents a comparative analysis of interconnected planning methodologies, each with distinct processes, components, and relationships. A property graph model effectively captures the multiple planning approaches, their constituent elements, assessment criteria, and the complex relationships between methodologies, conflict phases, organizational levels, and operational outcomes."
