annotation: "Presents the Generalizing Persuasion (GP) Framework, a comprehensive theoretical structure for understanding political persuasion through five key dimensions: actors (speakers and receivers), treatments (topics, content, media), outcomes (attitudes, behaviors, emotions, identities), and settings (competition, space, time, process, culture). The framework aims to unify fragmented persuasion research and explain contradictory findings by systematically accounting for variation across these dimensions."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The GP Framework is best represented as a property graph because it describes a complex network of interacting components where persuasion outcomes depend on relationships between actors, treatments, outcomes, and settings. The framework emphasizes how different combinations of these elements produce different persuasion effects, making it inherently relational and requiring representation of both entities (framework components) and their dynamic interactions."
