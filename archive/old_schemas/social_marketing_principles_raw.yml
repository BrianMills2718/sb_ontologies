annotation: "This chapter establishes the foundational principles of social marketing, distinguishing it from health communication and other behavior change approaches through its comprehensive marketing mix framework. It presents three strategic models (Rothschild's MOA framework, People and Places framework, and an Integrative Model) and extends social marketing beyond individual behavior change to encompass market systems and social change."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The theoretical framework represents a complex network of interconnected concepts, actors, processes, and relationships in social marketing practice. The property graph model best captures the multidirectional relationships between consumers, producers, mediators, environmental factors, marketing mix elements, and systemic market failures that characterize social marketing systems."
