annotation: "This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of behavior change methods based on the Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol. It distinguishes between theory-based methods and practical applications, emphasizes parameters for effectiveness, and addresses the dynamics of behavior change across multiple ecological levels. The taxonomy serves both intervention development and coding purposes, providing a structured approach to systematic behavior change intervention design."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The IM taxonomy represents a complex interconnected system of theoretical constructs, methods, determinants, applications, and effectiveness parameters. These elements form nodes with multiple types of relationships (targeting, embodying, influencing, translating, requiring) creating a comprehensive theoretical network. The multi-level ecological framework (individual through societal levels) and the six-step IM process create hierarchical and cross-level relationships that are best captured in a property graph model where nodes represent constructs and edges represent the various relationships between them."
