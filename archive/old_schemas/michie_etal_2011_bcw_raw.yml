annotation: "Presents the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework comprising the COM-B system (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behavior) at the hub, surrounded by nine intervention functions and seven policy categories for systematic behavior change intervention design."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The BCW represents a multi-layered system where behavioral components (COM-B) connect to intervention functions which connect to policy categories, forming a network of theoretical relationships, causal pathways, and systematic design processes best captured as interconnected nodes and edges."
