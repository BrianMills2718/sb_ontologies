citation: "Chapter 3: Determinants, Context, and Consequences for Individual and Social Change. In Social Marketing and Social Change."

annotation: "Comprehensive chapter analyzing theoretical frameworks for social marketing that addresses individual behavior change within social, community, and market contexts. Presents integration of psychological theories with social network, community development, and systems approaches to achieve scalable social change."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "This chapter presents a complex theoretical ecosystem with multiple interconnected theories, frameworks, and approaches that form relationships between individual-level constructs and macro-level social systems. The property graph model best captures the multi-level nature of determinants (individual, social, structural), contexts (networks, communities, markets), and consequences (individual behavior change, social diffusion, system change) along with their dynamic interactions and feedback loops."
