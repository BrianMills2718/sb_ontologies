annotation: "Comprehensive analysis of solutions and responses to information disorder, covering source identification, media literacy education, regulatory approaches, and policy frameworks. Examines the effectiveness of fact-checking, educational interventions, and regulatory measures across different jurisdictions."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The solutions framework involves complex multi-stakeholder relationships between educators, regulators, platforms, journalists, and citizens. A property graph model effectively captures the interconnected nature of countermeasures, their target populations, implementing organizations, and effectiveness outcomes. The model accommodates the dynamic interactions between different intervention types and their contextual dependencies."
