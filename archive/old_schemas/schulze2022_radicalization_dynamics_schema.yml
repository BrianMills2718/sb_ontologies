annotation: "Longitudinal study examining radicalization dynamics in far-right movements on Telegram through quantitative content analysis of conspiracy narratives, anti-elitism, political activism, and violence indicators across QAnon, Identitarian Movement, and Querdenken channels from March 2020 to February 2021."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "Property graph model is most appropriate as this study examines radicalization as a dynamic process involving relationships between actors (movements, platforms, elites), concepts (conspiracy narratives, ideologies), behaviors (activism, violence), and temporal patterns. The theoretical framework maps complex interactions between psychological factors, platform affordances, communication behaviors, and radicalization outcomes that are best represented as interconnected nodes and edges."
