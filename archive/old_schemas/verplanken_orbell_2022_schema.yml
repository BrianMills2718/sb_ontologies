annotation: "Comprehensive review examining the relationship between attitudes and habits in behavior change, proposing an integrated approach that recognizes both attitude-driven and habit-driven processes in understanding and promoting lasting behavior change."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The paper presents a complex theoretical framework with multiple interconnected constructs (attitudes, habits, behaviors, contexts, cues) and various types of relationships (causal, temporal, moderating, mediating). The property graph model best captures the network of theoretical entities and their diverse relationships, including feedback loops between attitude-behavior-habit formation, contextual influences, and intervention strategies."
