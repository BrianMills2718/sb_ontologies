annotation: "Interdisciplinary synthesis of 86 human action theories from across the humanities and social sciences, organizing them into eight foundational metatheories that reveal different assumptions about what drives human behavior and action."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The paper presents a systematic categorization of theories organized around metatheoretical assumptions, with clear relationships between disciplines, theories, metatheories, and their applications. The authors explicitly map theories to metatheories and describe interconnections between factors, making a property graph structure ideal for representing nodes (theories, metatheories, disciplines, factors) and edges (relationships, influences, applications)."
