annotation: "Comprehensive theoretical framework explaining how behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, and control beliefs determine attitudes, perceived norms, and perceived behavioral control, which in turn influence behavioral intentions and actual behavior performance."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The Reasoned Action Approach represents a clear property graph structure with distinct conceptual nodes (beliefs, attitudes, norms, control perceptions, intentions, behaviors) connected through well-defined causal relationships and moderating effects. The theory explicitly describes how background factors influence beliefs, how beliefs determine proximal constructs, and how these constructs combine to predict intentions and behavior."
