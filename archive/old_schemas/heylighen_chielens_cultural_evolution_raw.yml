annotation: "Comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding cultural evolution through memetic theory, examining how cultural information (memes) replicates, spreads, and evolves through mechanisms analogous to biological evolution, including analysis of transmission dynamics, selection criteria, and empirical testing approaches."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "Property graph model best captures the complex network of relationships between memes, carriers, transmission processes, and environmental factors. The framework involves multiple interconnected entities (memes, individuals, groups, mediotypes) with diverse relationship types (replication, selection, transmission, interaction) that form dynamic networks of cultural evolution."
