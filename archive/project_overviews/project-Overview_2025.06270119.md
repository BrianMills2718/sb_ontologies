# Project Overview: Computational Social Science Theory Modeling

## Strategic Goal

This project creates computational frameworks for comprehensive theoretical modeling of social phenomena by transforming academic papers in social and behavioral sciences into structured, machine-readable knowledge representations. The primary application is **computational social science** - using these theoretical frameworks to analyze discourse data for descriptive categorization, explanatory analysis, predictive forecasting, causal inference, and intervention design across social systems.

### Core Objectives

1. **Multi-Purpose Theoretical Modeling**: Support descriptive, explanatory, predictive, causal, and intervention analysis with equal sophistication across all theoretical purposes
2. **Multi-Paradigm Representation**: Support multiple model types (graphs, tables, sequences, trees, timelines, statistical models) based on each theory's inherent structure
3. **Theory-Driven Discourse Analysis**: Answer "who says what to whom in what channels in what settings with what effects" using formal theoretical frameworks across all modeling purposes
4. **Comprehensive Analytical Capabilities**: Enable taxonomic classification, mechanism understanding, outcome prediction, causal inference, and intervention design
5. **High-Fidelity Modeling**: Capture complete theoretical vocabulary, relationships, and structures without oversimplification across all theoretical purposes
6. **Computational Social Science Integration**: Bridge academic theory with quantitative analysis, prediction, and intervention design

## Current Methodology: Three-Phase Processing

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Vocabulary Extraction
- **Goal**: Extract ALL theoretical terms from academic papers
- **Process**: Deep reading to identify concepts, relationships, actions, properties, measures, modifiers
- **Output**: Complete vocabulary with definitions, context, and theoretical categories
- **Key Innovation**: No artificial limits on vocabulary size

### Phase 2: Ontological Classification
- **Goal**: Properly categorize terms according to semantic type
- **Process**: Classify into entities, relationships, properties, actions, measures, modifiers, truth values, operators
- **Output**: Structured classification with specific domain/range for relationships/actions
- **Key Innovation**: Preserves theoretical subcategories and infers specific type constraints

### Phase 3: Theory-Adaptive Schema Generation
- **Goal**: Create appropriate knowledge representation structure
- **Process**: Select optimal model type based on theory's inherent structure:
  - **property_graph**: For theories with rich interconnected relationships
  - **table_matrix**: For classification systems, typologies, or cross-tabulated data
  - **sequence**: For stage models, processes, or ordered progressions
  - **tree**: For hierarchical taxonomies or decision structures
  - **timeline**: For temporal evolution or historical development
  - **other**: For unique structures requiring custom representation
- **Output**: Complete JSON Schema with model-specific root properties
- **Key Innovation**: Genuinely evaluates and selects appropriate model type with detailed rationale

### Key Improvements Over Legacy System
1. **Semantic Correctness**: Only relationships/actions have domain/range (not entities)
2. **Comprehensive Extraction**: ~4x more vocabulary extracted
3. **Theoretical Nuance**: Preserves subcategories like "core-construct", "process-element"
4. **Hierarchical Support**: Maintains subTypeOf relationships
5. **Complete Ontology**: Includes modifiers, truth values, and operators

## Representation Paradigms and Interoperability

### Model Type Selection Criteria
Each theory has an inherent structure that suggests an optimal representation:

- **Property Graph**: When relationships are as important as entities (e.g., social networks, causal models)
- **Table/Matrix**: When data is naturally cross-tabulated (e.g., 2x2 classifications, feature matrices)
  - Represented as n-ary relations in schema, convertible to SQL tables later
- **Sequence**: When order and progression matter (e.g., stage theories, process models)
- **Tree**: When hierarchical relationships dominate (e.g., taxonomies, decision trees)
- **Timeline**: When temporal evolution is central (e.g., historical theories, developmental models)
- **Hybrid**: When theories require multiple representations for different aspects
  - Example: Social-Ecological Systems with graph relationships AND access rights matrices
- **Statistical**: For probabilistic theories (factor analysis, SEM, Bayesian networks)
- **Logical**: For formal reasoning systems (argumentation, deontic logic, action theories)
- **Causal**: For causal inference with DAGs, interventions, and counterfactual reasoning
- **Hybrid**: When theories require multiple representations for different aspects
  - Example: Adaptive Governance with belief networks + game matrices + governance sequences + statistical models + normative logic

## Comparison with TypeDB Capabilities

Through detailed analysis, we have identified key similarities and differences between our approach and TypeDB's polymorphic database system:

### Areas Where Our System Matches or Exceeds TypeDB

#### 1. **N-ary Relations (Hypergraphs)**
- **Our Approach**: Explicit n-ary relations in schema with defined roles and arity
- **TypeDB**: Native atomic n-ary relations
- **Assessment**: **Equivalent capability** - we handle this well through schema design
- **Example**: `institutional_game(player, action, others_profile, institution, payoff)`

#### 2. **Type Hierarchies and Subsumption**
- **Our Approach**: Explicit `subTypeOf` relationships with OWL reasoning support
- **TypeDB**: Automatic polymorphic query expansion across type hierarchies
- **Assessment**: **Equivalent with reasoning engines** - OWL reasoners can handle automatic subsumption
- **Gap**: Query engines (Neo4j, SQL) don't automatically expand unless using OWL reasoner

#### 3. **Complex Attribute Constraints**
- **Our Approach**: Required/optional properties, type constraints, validation rules
- **TypeDB**: Schema-enforced constraints with automatic validation
- **Assessment**: **Equivalent capability** - our validation approach achieves same outcomes
- **Example**: Required properties, unique constraints, type safety through schema validation

#### 4. **Schema Evolution**
- **Our Approach**: Edit schema files, reprocess data as needed
- **TypeDB**: Add subtypes without breaking existing queries
- **Assessment**: **Not needed for our use case** - academic theory schemas are stable
- **Context**: We analyze fixed academic papers, not evolving operational data

#### 5. **Relations Between Relations**
- **Our Approach**: Relationship reification when needed
- **TypeDB**: Native relation-to-relation connections
- **Assessment**: **Functionally equivalent** - reification handles this adequately
- **Example**: Marriage events can relate to divorce events via reified entities

### Areas Where TypeDB Has Technical Advantages We Don't Need

#### 1. **Automatic Type Inference in Queries**
- **TypeDB Advantage**: Queries automatically match all subtypes without enumeration
- **Our Context**: Not critical for discourse analysis - explicit enumeration is manageable
- **Reason**: Academic theory schemas have well-defined, stable type hierarchies

#### 2. **Atomic Transaction Enforcement**
- **TypeDB Advantage**: Database-level enforcement that n-ary relations are complete
- **Our Context**: **Actively disadvantageous** for discourse analysis
- **Reason**: We want to capture partial theoretical mentions, contradictory claims

#### 3. **Incremental Cross-Document Instance Completion**
- **TypeDB Advantage**: Automatically complete partial instances across new documents
- **Our Context**: **Problematic** for discourse analysis - would conflate separate claims
- **Reason**: Multiple sources making different claims about same concept should remain separate

### Why Our Approach Is Better Suited for Discourse Analysis

#### 1. **Claims vs. Ground Truth Modeling**
- **TypeDB Design**: Optimized for modeling single ground truth reality
- **Our Design**: Optimized for capturing multiple, contradictory discourse claims
- **Example**: TypeDB would merge conflicting statements about cooperation; we preserve each claim with source attribution

#### 2. **Source Attribution and Contradiction Preservation**
- **TypeDB**: Consolidates instances into single facts
- **Our Approach**: Maintains source attribution and allows contradictory claims
- **Critical For**: Rhetorical analysis, framing studies, discourse evolution tracking

#### 3. **Partial Instance Value**
- **TypeDB**: Incomplete instances are data quality problems to avoid
- **Our Approach**: Partial theoretical mentions are meaningful analytical data
- **Example**: A tweet mentioning only "cooperation" and "punishment" is valid discourse data

#### 4. **Processing Flexibility**
- **TypeDB**: Real-time insertion with immediate validation
- **Our Approach**: Batch processing with configurable completeness thresholds
- **Advantage**: Can analyze both complete and partial theoretical instantiations
