annotation: The paper introduces the Semantic Hypergraph (SH), a recursive knowledge-representation
  model that merges symbolic transparency with machine-learning adaptability for natural-language
  understanding. It situates SH within an openâ€“adaptive paradigm and empirically demonstrates
  its utility across several NLP tasks using hybrid ML-symbolic pipelines.

model_type: hypergraph
rationale: SH explicitly models sentences as nested hyperedges that capture n-ary
  and recursive semantic relations, making the hypergraph paradigm the most faithful
  representation of the theory.
