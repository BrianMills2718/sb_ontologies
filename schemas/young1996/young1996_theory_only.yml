model_type: network
theory_name: young1996_cognitive_mapping
extraction_method: simplified_meta_schema
nodes:
- id: concept
  label: Concept Node
  type: concept
  description: Any noun-phrase or idea extracted from text. One unique node is created
    for every unique concept that appears in the data set.
- id: relationship
  label: Relationship Node
  type: relationship
  description: A symbol designating the link that holds between a subject-concept
    and an object-concept. In WorldView relationships themselves are elevated to full
    nodes so they, too, can become the subject or object of other relationships.
- id: conjunction
  label: Conjunction Node
  type: conjunction
  description: Either the AND or OR operator indicating multi-actor joint action (AND)
    or sets of alternatives (OR). Like other nodes, conjunctions store their own lists
    of subjects and objects.
connections:
- type: relationship_link
  description: An ordered pair ⟨subject-concept , relationship-node , object-concept⟩.
    Direction is always from subject toward object. Because relationship names are
    themselves nodes, higher-order (n-ary) structures are supported.
  properties:
    directed: true
    arity: binary at surface; n-ary once relationships are chained via elevation

properties:
  node_properties:
  - subject_list (concepts/relationships for which this node is subject)
  - object_list (concepts/relationships for which this node is object)
  connection_properties:
  - truth_value
  - modifier
  - salience
  measures:
    dependency: number between 0 and 1 indicating proportion of bridge relationships
      per structure
    connectedness: number between 0 and 1 (asymptotic) reflecting density of relationship
      links
    size: count of concept nodes in the map
    uniformity_of_salience: standard deviation of salience values across all relationship
      nodes
    transformation_cost: edit-distance count of discrete changes needed to convert
      map A into map B
    incongruence: combined index of transformation_cost and qualitative concept differences
  formulas:
    dependency: D_G = ( |bridges_G| / |relationships_G| ) / |structures_G|
    connectedness: C_G = |relationships_G| / ( Σ concepts_G  +  Σ relationships_G|
      )
    uniformity_of_salience: σ_salience = sqrt( Σ (s_i − μ)^2 / N ) where s_i is salience
      of relationship i
    transformation_cost: 'TC(A,B) = min Σ cost(edit_k) ; cost(edit)=1 for each of:
      relationship-addition, relationship-deletion, ±1 salience change, concept-addition,
      concept-deletion'

mechanisms:
- name: Relationship Elevation
  description: All relationship labels become nodes so that relationships themselves
    can serve as subjects or objects of other relationships.
  process: Transforms compound or nested propositions into fully connected sub-graphs
    without information loss.
- name: Synonym Substitution
  description: At compilation time, user-defined synonym sets collapse multiple lexical
    items into a single concept node.
  process: Improves aggregation and allows sensitivity tests by varying synonym inclusiveness.
- name: Salience Updating
  description: Each occurrence of an identical relationship increments its salience
    count.
  process: Salience values feed search heuristics and provide data for uniformity_of_salience
    computation.
- name: Directed-Walk Reasoning
  description: Explanation-based search that follows the most salient unprocessed
    relationship from the current node.
  process: 1) repeat or integrate new input; 2) select highest-salience available
    link; 3) chain until no further progress; 4) output conclusion or integrate information.
- name: Spreading Activation
  description: Automatic activation flow from an accessed concept across adjacent
    relationships proportionally to their salience.
  process: Produces the definition–of–the–situation layer used by Directed-Walk.
notation:
  type_codes:
    concept: plain string
    relationship: symbol from vocabulary list
    conjunction: AND | OR
  symbols:
    +: positive-cause
    '-': negative-cause
    '=': equal
    '>': preference/greater-than
  formal_notation:
  - (subject  relationship  truth-value  modifier  object)
  - 'Examples: (oil-pollution  +  true present  sea-birds)'
  - 'Conjunctions: (AND concept1 concept2 …)'
  - 'Nested: relationships may themselves occupy the subject or object slot.'
rules:
- name: Bridge Identification
  description: A relationship is a bridge when only one pathway leads to its object
    concept.
  formula: bridge? (rel) = ( indegree(object(rel)) == 1 )
- name: Truth-Value Precedence
  description: When conflicting truth-values occur, apply precedence ordering.
  formula: true/partial > possible   ;   impossible > false
- name: Transformation Cost Edit Weights
  description: All five edit operations are weighted equally.
  formula: cost(edit_k)=1  ∀ k ∈ {rel_add, rel_del, salience±1, concept_add, concept_del}
- name: Salience Heuristic for Directed-Walk
  description: Select next relationship with maximum salience among unprocessed links
    emanating from current node.
  formula: next_rel = argmax_{r ∈ frontier} salience(r)
