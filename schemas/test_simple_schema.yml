annotation: The paper introduces hypergraphs as a natural extension of graphs in which
  hyperedges can join any subset of vertices, enabling direct representation of n-ary
  relationships. It argues that this structure captures complex connections more effectively
  than simple binary edges.

model_type: property_graph
rationale: A property-graph (or hypergraph-enabled graph) model is ideal because terms
  revolve around vertices, hyperedges, and their annotated properties/metrics, all
  of which map cleanly onto nodes, edges, and edge attributes.
