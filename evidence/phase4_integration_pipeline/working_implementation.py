        Social cognitive theory explains behavior through the dynamic interaction of personal, 
        behavioral, and environmental factors. This comprehensive framework categorizes learning 
        mechanisms into observational learning, direct experience, and symbolic modeling. 
        
        Key variables include self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and behavioral capability, 
        which interact through triadic reciprocal causation. The theory predicts that individuals 
        with higher self-efficacy are more likely to engage in target behaviors and persist in 
        the face of obstacles.
        
        Causal pathways demonstrate how environmental factors influence personal cognitions and 
        emotional states, which in turn affect behavioral choices and outcomes. These relationships 
        show circular causality where behavior also influences the environment and personal factors.
        
        Interventions based on this theory typically focus on enhancing self-efficacy through 
        mastery experiences, vicarious learning, verbal persuasion, and emotional arousal management. 
        Implementation strategies include skill building, environmental modification, cognitive 
        restructuring, and social support enhancement to optimize behavioral outcomes.

        Systems theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding complex organizations 
        and social phenomena through the lens of interconnected networks and feedback mechanisms. 
        This meta-theoretical approach categorizes systems into open, closed, and semi-permeable 
        types based on their boundary characteristics and environmental interactions.
        
        The framework identifies key variables such as input-throughput-output processes, 
        feedback loops, and system boundaries that predict organizational performance and 
        adaptability. Systems theory forecasts that organizations with better feedback 
        mechanisms and adaptive capacity will demonstrate superior resilience.
        
        Causal analysis in systems theory reveals how small changes at leverage points can 
        propagate through interconnected subsystems, leading to system-wide transformations. 
        This demonstrates the power of understanding systemic relationships rather than 
        isolated components.
        
        Intervention strategies focus on identifying leverage points where small changes can 
        produce significant system-wide effects. Implementation approaches include boundary 
        modification, feedback adjustment, and capacity building to enhance overall system 
        functioning and achieve desired outcomes.

        Complexity theory offers a powerful framework for understanding emergent properties 
        and nonlinear dynamics in social and organizational systems. This approach distinguishes 
        between complicated systems (with predictable relationships) and complex systems 
        (with emergent, nonlinear interactions).
        
        Key variables in complexity theory include connectivity, diversity, and adaptive 
        capacity, which interact to produce emergent outcomes. The theory predicts that 
        systems with optimal levels of these variables will demonstrate greater innovation 
        and adaptability while avoiding both chaos and rigidity.
        
        Causal relationships in complex systems are characterized by circular causality, 
        sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and multi-directional influences among 
        system agents. This creates nonlinear cause-and-effect patterns that cannot be 
        reduced to simple linear relationships.
        
        Intervention approaches in complexity theory focus on creating conditions for 
        positive emergence rather than direct control mechanisms. Implementation strategies 
        include skillful perturbations, enabling constraints, and fostering self-organization 
        to guide system evolution toward desired attractor states.
