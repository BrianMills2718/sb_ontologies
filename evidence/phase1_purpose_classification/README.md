- Continuous bias monitoring

## Usage

```python
from purpose_classifier import PurposeClassifier

classifier = PurposeClassifier()
result = classifier.classify_theory_purposes(theory_text)

print(f"Primary Purpose: {result['primary_purpose']}")
print(f"Secondary Purposes: {result['secondary_purposes']}")
print(f"Balance Check: {result['balanced_analysis']['balance_check']}")
```
