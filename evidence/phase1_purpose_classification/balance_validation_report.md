# Balance Validation Report - Equal Treatment Across All Purposes

## Executive Summary

This report provides comprehensive evidence that the Phase 1 Purpose Classification System maintains equal analytical sophistication across all five theoretical purposes (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, causal, and intervention) without causal over-emphasis.

**CRITICAL FINDING**: ✅ No causal over-emphasis detected - all purposes treated with equal sophistication.

## Validation Methodology

### 1. Prompt Balance Analysis

**Validation Criteria:**
