annotation: "Comprehensive framework identifying 300+ methods and tools for social innovation across four economic sectors (public, grant, market, household), structured around innovation stages from idea generation to systemic transformation."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The paper presents a complex network of interconnected innovation methods, economic sectors, processes, and systemic relationships that can be effectively modeled as nodes (concepts, methods, sectors) and edges (relationships, interfaces, processes). The four-sector architecture with six interfaces and multi-stage innovation processes naturally fits a property graph structure."
