annotation: "A comprehensive guide to Stephen Toulmin's method for analyzing arguments, providing a systematic framework for breaking down arguments into component parts (claim, reasons, evidence, qualifiers, exceptions, objections, rebuttals) and evaluating their effectiveness through relevance, sufficiency, credibility, and accuracy criteria."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The Toulmin Method represents a structured analytical framework with clear hierarchical relationships between argumentative components. A property graph model best captures the interconnected nature of claims, reasons, evidence, and rebuttals, along with the evaluative processes that assess their effectiveness. The method involves both structural elements (nodes representing argument components) and relational processes (edges representing support relationships, evaluation criteria, and logical connections)."
