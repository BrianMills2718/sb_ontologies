annotation: "Develops a systematic typology of 16 social media rituals that organize user-generated content into patterned communicative practices expressing shared values. Integrates ritual theory with genre analysis to identify core and communicative values underlying digital practices ranging from promotion to disclosure."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The social media ritual framework maps relationships between ritual types, genres, values, and communicative practices. This creates a networked structure where rituals connect to multiple genres, values, and communicative modes. The property graph model captures these multi-dimensional relationships and hierarchical categorizations while representing the theoretical taxonomy as interconnected nodes and edges."
