Abstract
Extending interactionist principles and targeting situational specificity of
trait–performance linkages, trait activation theory (TAT) posits personal-
ity traits are expressed as valued work behavior in response to trait-relevant
situational cues, subject to constraints and other factors, all operating at
the task, social, and organizational levels. Review of 99 key sources citing
TAT spanning 2011–2019 reveals diverse applications (e.g., bidirectional-
ity, trait specificity, team building) and an overall 60% significance rate for
262 TAT-based moderator effects reported in 60 of 75 empirical studies.
Applying five key aspects of TAT (e.g., behavior/performance distinction,
need-based motivation) to five lines of personality dynamics research (e.g.,
personality states, self-regulation models of motivation) supports TAT as a
vehicle for advancing understanding of within-person variability over brief
and extended timelines. Critical research needs include personality-oriented
work analysis, longitudinal study of trait-situation processes, trait activation
in teams, within-job bidirectionality, and situation relevance as a unifying
principle in advancing person–workplace fit.

In the middle of the past century, as the field of psychology was coming to terms with the
inadequacies of black-box behaviorism, it struggled to determine whether traits or situations are
the primary sources of behavioral variance. The person–situation debate resolved in the 1970s
in the form of person–situation interactionism (e.g., Bowers 1973, Ekehammar 1974, Endler &
Magnusson 1976). The answer was that traits and situations, like two sides of a coin (Eysenck &
Eysenck 1985), are inseparable: One cannot talk meaningfully about one without invoking the
other. The debate was resolved by realizing it was fundamentally untenable.
Years before that resolution, Guion & Gottier (1965) had summarized approximately a decade
of personality applications in the workplace, concluding personality tests could not be recom-
mended for predicting valued organizational outcomes. The low rates of significant effects might
have supported a situationist position; however, anticipating the forthcoming reconciliation,
Guion & Gottier (1965) cautioned that a trait’s value depends on the situation:
In short, it must be concluded (as always) that the validity of any personality measure must be specifically
and competently determined for the specific situation in which it is to be used and for the specific
purpose or criterion within that situation. (p. 160)
The advent of psychometric meta-analysis in the 1970s (e.g., Schmidt et al. 1979), together
with the discovery of a relatively robust taxonomy of five major personality dimensions [the five-
factor model (FFM): neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness
(e.g., Tupes & Christal 1958)], permitted refined assessment of the value of personality in pre-
dicting work outcomes. Barrick & Mount (1991) identified conscientiousness as the best overall
predictor and the one most consistently predictive across multiple job families; extraversion was
found to be predictive in management and sales. Notable variability in the strength and, in some
cases, the direction of validity estimates within broad trait–job family pairings suggested untapped
situational specificity.
Soon afterward, Tett et al. (1991) published a meta-analysis on personality–job performance
linkages focusing on situational specificity operationalized in terms of confirmatory versus ex-
ploratory research strategies. Confirmatory strategies target particular trait–outcome relations
based on job analysis, a rationale, and/or prior research, whereas exploratory cases offer no such
foundation (essentially crap shoots). In support of situational specificity, mean validity estimates
from the confirmatory cases were twice as strong as those from exploratory cases. Moreover, as
expected, validity strengthened when confirmatory designs were driven by job analysis. Tett et al.
(1999) largely replicated the original results using refined methods.
Given personality validity estimates vary systematically within broad trait–job family and trait–
criterion pairings (e.g., Barrick & Mount 1991) and validity is stronger where traits are selected a
priori in light of local situational contingencies (Tett et al. 1991, 1999), it begs the question as to
how this occurs, and, further, whether the process might be leveraged to improve the predictive
yields from personality in work settings.
Introduced as a principle for answering those questions, trait activation has been used fre-
quently since publication of two introductory articles. Tett & Guterman (2000) showed trait ex-
pressions as intentions are more consistent across situations more similarly trait relevant, and Tett
& Burnett (2003) fleshed out a broader conceptual model. Tett et al. (2013) summarized applica-
tions up to 2011 and expanded the model in key respects. Extending those efforts, our primary
aims here are to (a) articulate the key features of trait activation theory (TAT) and its applications,
(b) summarize how TAT has been used in the literature from 2011 to 2019 and its effectiveness as a
basis for trait–outcome moderation, and (c) apply TAT in advancing dynamic personality processes
in the workplace. We begin with a brief introduction to personality.

Personality captures people’s characteristic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, allowing distinctions
among individuals and, to varying degrees, prediction of how they will think, feel, and behave in
the future. Individuation and prediction are critical for human survival and reproductive success.
Who can be trusted? Who would make a good mate? They are also important in work settings
where some job applicants, coworkers, and teammates are chosen over others as likely to perform
well. Personality covers a broad range of individuating proclivities potentially relevant to valued
organizational outcomes. Given increasing competition for human capital (e.g., Gardner 2005,
Shaw et al. 2013), it is hardly surprising personality has become a popular target of organizational
research (e.g., LePine et al. 2011, Rothstein & Goffin 2006).
At least implicit in any understanding of personality is consideration of the situations in which
personality plays out. Whenever people think, feel, and behave, they do so in reaction to salient
features of their environment. Individuation and prediction, accordingly, are best framed in con-
text: We identify people as distinct when we see them react differently to the same cues (one person
avoids danger while another approaches it; one eagerly takes up an invitation to socialize while
another turns it down), and our prediction of an individual’s behavior depends on the similarity of
past and future cues. Figures are visible only against a background—so too with personality and
situations.
TRAIT ACTIVATION THEORY: MAIN FEATURES
Situation Trait Relevance
Building on early interactionist thinking (e.g., Allport 1951, Lewin 1936, Murray 1938), TAT
considers personality traits as latent potentials to behave (think, feel 1 ) in identifiable ways (i.e., as
indicative of one trait versus another) in response to trait-relevant situational cues. As with tools
on a tool belt, traits are engaged when called on by the right type of situation. Someone high in
sociability behaves sociably only when other people are available with whom to engage. In TAT
terms, this triggering feature of situations is situation trait relevance: 2 A situation is relevant to
a trait to the degree it offers opportunity for that trait to be expressed. Trait-relevant situations
often have a main effect on behavior (e.g., socially engaging situations tend to increase sociable
behavior in everyone present). Equally importantly, however, they expose individual differences
on relevant traits: Social gatherings, better than any other type of situation, reveal who is and is
not sociable.
Trait relevance is a key situational feature that makes a trait observable as an individual differ-
ence variable. Thus, when examining a given trait and its relationships with targeted outcomes,
it is important to do so in trait-relevant situations. TAT builds on this fundamental principle in
several key respects.
Functional Situational Features
Unique to TAT is its articulation of six types of trait-relevant situational features, distinguished
by how they moderate trait–outcome relationships. Tett & Burnett (2003) identified the first five;
Tett et al. (2013) identified the sixth.
1 Trait expressions can include thoughts, feelings, and overt behaviors. We focus primarily on the latter because
they are directly observable, permitting translation into work performance rated by others.
2 Murray (1938) referred to this as press; Haaland & Christiansen (2002) call it trait activation potential, when
operating in weak situations.

Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Guest (guest) IP: 199.83.221.44 On: Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:06:33Demands are cues, responses to which are positively valued: Meeting a demand is a good thing.
Conversely, distracters are cues, responses to which are valued negatively. An informal gathering
of coworkers might distract those high on sociability from completing their assigned tasks. Both
demands and distracters are trait activators; responses to a demand yield a positive relationship
between the activated trait and a positively valued outcome, whereas responses to a distracter yield
a negative relationship.3
Constraints are situational features rendering a given trait less relevant, thereby weakening the
trait–outcome relationship. Physical distance separating a manager from subordinates constrains
the relevance of sociability as a predictor of performance. Releasers counter constraints, operating
as intermittent trait activators. For a physically isolated manager, a company retreat in Las Vegas
might serve as a releaser of sociability, allowing it to correlate with relevant outcomes. A facilitator
is uniquely multiplicative in that it enhances the salience or potency of trait-relevant cues already
present. An ad extolling the playful opportunities in Las Vegas would amplify the sociability cues
afforded by the retreat.
Discretionary cues account for trait effects untethered to valued outcomes. They are related
to the general factor of work autonomy, which itself is tied to (low) situation strength. Discre-
tionary cues are distinct from work autonomy (and weak situations) by their alignment to specific
traits. A production supervisor position may not require creativity for effective performance but
might nonetheless offer opportunity for creative expression (e.g., in developing training games).
A sales job might offer cues for altruism (e.g., to assist peers) despite altruism not being expected,
rewarded, or punished in any way. The key here is motivation: The creative supervisor and the
altruistic salesperson will be more engaged in meeting their respective work demands when their
jobs offer opportunity to engage those discretionary traits. Such cues are not definitive of the job,
yet they offer unique contributions to trait-based fit (Tett et al. 2013).
Operational Levels
In the workplace, the primary situational features affecting trait expression are task-level features,
including all the day-to-day demands identified in a job description (e.g., budget preparation, fork-
lift operation) and less overt demands (e.g., prompt attendance, rule-following), distracters, con-
straints, etc. Social-level (alternatively, group-level or team-level) features include the behaviors
of peers, subordinates, and superiors, as well as norms and team culture/climate. Organization-
level features operate within organizational culture and climate (e.g., policies, reward systems).
Notably, the levels overlap. Management, leadership, and customer service jobs, for example, in-
clude task-level social demands. Team-based organizational cultures are similarly boundary span-
ning. Despite the overlaps, the three levels are well recognized in other workplace literatures
[e.g., person–environment (PE) fit (Kristof-Brown & Guay 2010)]. Personality applications in the
workplace often target task-level effects in the context of personnel selection, where meeting job-
specific task demands is the primary predictive aim. Social- and organization-level demands are
increasingly targeted in personality research, expanding bases for improving personality-based fit
in the workplace.
Trait Expression as (Valued) Performance
In addressing the noted bidirectionality of personality–performance relationships, TAT proposes
that positive and negative correlations involving a given trait are distinguished by the value of the
3 Where the outcome is negatively valued [e.g., counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs)], a distracter yields
a positive relationship.

shown, for example, that agreeableness is positively related to performance in some managerial
jobs and negatively related in other managerial jobs.4 Agreeableness may be activated by similar
trait-relevant cues; what varies is whether meeting demands is facilitated or hindered by managers’
expressed agreeableness. The behavior/performance distinction thus separates the processes of
trait activation and performance judgment. Observers (e.g., supervisors, peers) are active players
in trait–performance linkages, converting behavioral observations into performance evaluations
in light of how well a given behavior meets work demands. Accordingly, demands are both key
trait activators and reference points for performance judgment.
Motivation
TAT articulates four sources of trait-based work motivation. (a) Trait expression is intrinsically
motivating as need satisfaction, akin to how drinking satiates thirst (Murray 1938). Extroverts
seek out and respond to sociability cues because they derive pleasure from engaging others (Smillie
2013). (b) Knowledge of performance results is motivating to the degree the worker is achieve-
ment oriented: Performance feedback informs level of actual achievement, which is particularly
salient to those higher on achievement need. (c) Per behaviorist reinforcement principles, trait ex-
pressions judged by others (e.g., as job performance) confer extrinsically motivating outcomes:
salary, praise, etc., for positive evaluations; demotion, shunning, etc., for negative evaluations.
(d) Extrinsic motivation is elevated in workers whose traits are aligned with valued outcomes (i.e.,
differential reward preference). The chance to be employee of the month, for example, may be
especially motivating to an extrovert and shunning to a worker high on need for approval.
TRAIT ACTIVATION THEORY APPLICATIONS
TAT offers an integrated framework for investigating critical issues involving personality at work.
The model was developed explicitly to account for the following applications.
Proximate applications:
1. Explicitly proposed to account for variability in personality–job performance relationships
across situations (i.e., situational specificity), TAT promotes situation trait relevance as a
general moderating principle (Tett & Burnett 2003; Tett et al. 1991, 1994, 1999).
2. Bidirectionality occurs when a given trait is positively or negatively related to job perfor-
mance depending on the work setting (Tett & Burnett 2003; Tett et al. 1991, 1994, 1999).
Although often ignored, this special case of situational specificity is a critical consideration
in meta-analyses of trait–outcome relations, as averaging positive and negative population
estimates can grossly underestimate validity strength and hence the predictive value of per-
sonality (Tett et al. 1999, Tett & Christiansen 2007).
3. Cross-situational consistency in behavior, an elusive hallmark of stable traits, is understood
in TAT to be a function of similarity in situation trait relevance (Tett & Guterman 2000).
4. Work autonomy is represented in TAT in terms of trait-specific discretionary cues (Tett et al.
2013), offering a unique basis for trait-based motivation independent of extrinsic outcomes.
4 Meta-analyses showing this do not identify which managerial jobs yield positive versus negative correlations;
the evidence derives from 80% credibility intervals extending in both directions. Such intervals, with weak
mean correlations, are common for agreeableness in management (see Tett & Christiansen 2007).

& Endler 1977, Weiss & Adler 1984). TAT proposes corresponding mechanisms by which
trait expressions (as behavior) can (a) increase trait-relevant situational cues (positive feed-
back loop) or (b) decrease them (negative feedback loop).
Intermediate applications:
6. Offering a trait-based approach to person–workplace fit, TAT holds that people are happier
and perform best in jobs, groups, and organizations where they are intrinsically and extrinsi-
cally rewarded for being themselves. By the same token, organizations prefer and are more
successful with workers whose traits are motivating by their alignment with extant work
demands and reward contingencies (Tett et al. 2013).
7. Personality-oriented work analysis is a natural extension of TAT: Trait-based personnel se-
lection should be enhanced by targeting identification of situational features (e.g., demands,
distracters) operating at multiple levels (task, group, organization) relevant to particular
traits and rewards (O’Neill et al. 2013).
8. Situational taxonomies, frequently invited but rarely delivered (Rauthmann et al. 2014), are
derivable with TAT by identifying classes of similarly trait-relevant situations (e.g., Ho &
Gupta 2012, Parrigon et al. 2017).
9. Construct specificity offers key predictive advantages (e.g., Kholin et al. 2016, Rojon et al.
2015, Rothstein & Goffin 2006). TAT holds that trait-based predictions of work outcomes
should improve with greater trait and criterion specificity because it feeds confirmatory
precision in trait–situation linkages.
Distal applications:
10. TAT offers an interactionist basis for team-building: Teams should be more viable when
members have what it takes not only to meet team task and role demands, but also to bring
out the best work in one another via mutual trait activation [i.e., chemistry (Tett & Murphy
2002)].
11. Traits have been shown to play out in complex trait-by-trait interactions (e.g., Witt
2002, Witt et al. 2004). TAT can frame those effects in light of trait-relevant situational
complexities.
12. TAT offers a unique approach to understanding halo bias in performance appraisal: Per-
son A will rate person B positively on diverse dimensions to the degree B provides A the
opportunity to express traits in positively valued ways (intrinsically and extrinsically), po-
tentially overpowering evaluation of B’s true performance and differential assessment on
distinct performance dimensions.
13. Although centered on personality traits, TAT readily extends to activation of knowledge,
skills, and abilities (KSAs),5 with the key distinction that only personality traits carry intrin-
sic motivational force as need satisfaction (Tett et al. 2013).
14. Finally, TAT can augment and expand application of other theories, including social-
cognitive mechanisms involving dispositions (e.g., conscientiousness, impulsivity), social ex-
change principles (e.g., LMX theory), as well as personality states, self-regulation (SR), and
other processes in the context of dynamic person–situation systems.
5 Even general cognitive ability shows situational specificity as a function of job complexity (Hunter et al.
1990).

SUMMARY OF THE TRAIT ACTIVATION THEORY LITERATURE
(2011–2019)
As with Tett et al.’s (2013) review, sources for the current review were identified by tracking ci-
tations of Tett & Guterman (2000) and Tett & Burnett (2003) in the PsycInfo database. We also
tracked citations of Tett et al. (2013). Sources were mined independently by the three authors,
targeting TAT’s features and applications presented above. We also tracked whether or not TAT
is cited in direct reference to the given issue in clarifying reliance on TAT within sources citing
it.6 Ambiguous cases in all aspects of the mining were resolved by consensus.
The earlier search, covering 2002–2011, yielded 189 published sources citing the introductory
articles. Of the 184 available sources, 23 (13%) targeted TAT as a main focus and another 88 (48%),
as a secondary but explicit focus. Corresponding counts for the current search period are 389 in
total,7 34 (9%) targeting TAT as a main focus and 65 (16%) as a secondary but explicit focus.
Figure 1 tracks the frequencies of primary, secondary, and tertiary sources by year since 2002.
Empirical sources outpaced conceptual sources in the earlier review by 121 (66%) to 63 (34%),
compared to 293 (75%) versus 90 (25%) in the current review. Figure 2 shows corresponding
frequencies by year.
This birds-eye view suggests (a) the 2:1 ratio of empirical to conceptual applications evident up
to 2011 (i.e., 66:34) has shifted to a 3:1 ratio more recently (i.e., 75:25); (b) the 12/48/40 propor-
tional split in primary/secondary/tertiary citations evident up to 2011 has become a 9/16/75 split,
showing a relative drop in primary and especially secondary applications offset by an increase in
tertiary, mostly empirical applications; and (c) TAT citations continued an upward trajectory from
the first review until 2015, at which point the trend reversed.8 As in the 2013 review, only those
sources relying primarily and secondarily on TAT are summarized in detail here.
6 Sources citing TAT directly for some issues often address other relevant issues independently of TAT.
7 PsycInfo captures a subset of sources citing the noted articles. An April 2020 search in Google Scholar, for
example, yielded more than 1,600 citations of Tett & Burnett (2003) for the same review period. Reliance on
PsycInfo provided a manageable number of peer-reviewed sources and comparability to the earlier review.
8 Google Scholar does not show a corresponding drop. The reason for the discrepancy is unclear.

Situation Trait Relevance and Situational Specificity
Sources citing TAT with respect to situational specificity of personality-outcome relations do so
in terms of situation trait relevance. Accordingly, those concepts are combined here. Of the 99
primary or secondary sources, 90 9 targeted situational specificity, 84 with direct ties to TAT. The
high rate of reliance on TAT for this purpose is not surprising, given the theory’s emphasis on
situation trait relevance. Most cases involve FFM linkages with performance in particular jobs.
Others extend to job stages (Woods et al. 2013), assessment centers (ACs) (e.g., Melchers et al.
2012), team settings (e.g., Heidemeier & Bittner 2012), virtual versus real-life settings (McLeod
et al. 2014), and nonwork settings (e.g., De Fruyt & De Clercq 2014) as well as to relations in-
volving nonperformance outcomes, such as values and work attitudes (e.g., Bergman et al. 2013),
motivation (e.g., Woods et al. 2013), and affect (e.g., Dimotakis et al. 2012). Such breadth of ap-
plication supports the generalizability of situation relevance as a key variable in understanding
person–outcome linkages.
Functional Situational Features
Of the 99 reviewed sources, 49 identified situational features related to trait expression (e.g., de-
mands, distracters), 42 making specific reference to TAT. Debusscher et al. (2016), for example,
examined work pressure and task complexity as distracters for state neuroticism in predicting mo-
mentary task performance. Bouckenooghe et al. (2013) examined job satisfaction 10 as a facilitator
of positive affectivity relating to job performance and turnover intentions. Other studies invoked
situational features consistent with the TAT taxonomy but without explicitly identifying it. For ex-
ample, Chen et al. (2013) presented rule-oriented organizational culture as a mitigator of negative
affect expression as CWB, the culture operating as a TAT constraint on negative affect.
9 Percentages of the 99 reviewed sources are omitted because they are virtually identical to the raw frequencies.
10 According to the researchers, more satisfied workers attend more closely to situational cues, thereby amplify-
ing their effects. TAT, as originally proposed, does not specify psychological moderators. Below, we document
this and other extensions of TAT separately.
206 Tett • Toich • Ozkum
Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Guest (guest) IP: 199.83.221.44 On: Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:06:33The 2013 review revealed reference to distinct situational features in 8% of sources. The rise
to 50% in the current effort reflects increasing recognition of the variety of ways situations can
affect trait expression and trait–outcome linkages. No moderator effects were observed outside
the TAT taxonomy, suggesting the framework is comprehensive in organizing interactions by
functional type.
Operational Levels
Of the 74 empirical articles, 44 (59%) applied TAT at the task level, 28 (38%) at the social level,
and 10 (14%) at the organization level. Across all 99 reviewed sources, 40 explicitly discussed inter-
actions as operating at one or more levels, 35 with direct reference to TAT. Fourteen targeted two
or more levels, mostly combining task and social levels. Schmidt et al. (2012), for example, exam-
ined the influence of team-level dissimilarity in extraversion and conscientiousness on task-level
FFM relations with individual performance and CWBs. These studies underscore the importance
of understanding the multi-level influence of trait expression. Choi et al. (2015) and De Fruyt &
Wille (2013) extended trait activation to national culture, adding a fourth level.
Separation of Behavior and Performance
Twenty sources explicitly or implicitly distinguished performance as valued behavior, four drawing
directly from TAT. Blickle et al. (2013), for example, articulate the trait expression/performance
distinction in showing conscientiousness predicts task performance when professional roles trig-
ger both learning orientation and political skill. Ten sources make the distinction implicitly, most
in the context of bidirectionality. Most sources ignore the behavior/performance distinction, at-
tributing value to the trait itself. Linking conscientiousness to detailed task performance does not
require separate evaluation of conscientious behavior. Trait evaluation is a convenient heuristic
for the trait–behavior–performance chain. Studies of bidirectionality and the active role of perfor-
mance judges invite clearer separation under TAT.
Bidirectionality
Thirteen papers discussed moderation of the direction of predictor–outcomes linkages, eight tying
such effects directly to TAT. Simonet et al. (2017), for example, reported bidirectional effects of
dark-side traits as a function of managerial level: Reactive narcissists performing poorly as “loose
cannons” at lower levels may be effective as “tough talkers” at upper levels (p. 245). All but one
case of bidirectionality was reported between work settings. Xu et al. (2014) discuss bidirection-
ality in leadership in the context of dynamic personality processes. Evidence for bidirectionality,
whether between or within jobs, underscores concerns that meta-analyses ignoring it (e.g., Barrick
& Mount 1991, Hurtz & Donovan 2000) underestimate the predictive power of personality due
to cancellation of positive and negative effects (Tett et al. 1991, 1994, 1999, Tett & Christiansen
2007).
Trait-Based Motivation
Intrinsic motivation from trait expression was discussed in 19 sources, 15 with direct ties to TAT.
For example, Hirst et al. (2011) argued people high on learning goal orientation are intrinsically
motivated to face new challenges, especially when unimpeded by bureaucracy. Fifteen sources
cited TAT explicitly with respect to extrinsic motivation. Van Hoye & Turban (2015), for instance,
hypothesized applicants are attracted to organizations rewarding traits they possess. Extrinsic re-
wards can also restrict trait effects. For example, Liguori et al. (2013) suggested conscientiousness
www.annualreviews.org • Trait Activation Theory 207

geted differential reward preference (Tett et al. 2013), whereby traits affect the motivational force
of different outcomes. This remains a mostly open question from a TAT perspective.
Cross-Situational Consistency
Four sources cited cross-situational consistency. Christiansen et al. (2013), for example, describe
how TAT can be used to address this in ACs, (see also Lievens et al. 2006) and Campion &
Ployhart (2013) make a similar point with respect to situational judgment tests (SJTs). TAT
may help address long-standing concerns regarding construct validity in ACs by holding that
consistency across exercises (e.g., in-basket, leaderless group discussion) occurs only to the
degree those methods activate the same traits with similar value (e.g., Haaland & Christiansen
2002, Lievens et al. 2015). Applications of TAT to modeling behavioral consistency in other
multi-situation assessments await empirical investigation.
Situation Strength and Autonomy
Situation strength was noted in 46 of the reviewed sources, making it the third most commonly
raised issue, behind only situation trait relevance (90) and functional cue types (50). In 32 cases,
strength was linked closely to TAT, mostly hand-in-hand with situation trait-relevance effects.
Fulmer & Walker (2015), for example, found extroverted and less conscientious workers per-
formed better under a piece-rate reward contingency in a weaker, unstructured task but not a
stronger, structured task. Judge & Zapata (2015) meta-analytically compared situation trait rele-
vance and situation strength as moderators of personality–performance linkages. Such direct com-
parisons are not surprising, given both factors have been identified as important in understanding
trait–situation interactions.
Dynamic Interaction
Six sources discuss behavioral effects of traits on situations, in three cases as part of the targeted
trait. Proactive personality, for example, entails efforts to modify one’s environment (e.g., Li
et al. 2011). Two sources tie dynamic interaction directly to TAT. Sung et al. (2014), for ex-
ample, do so in terms of mutual trait activation (Tett & Murphy 2002). This process can be
understood as involving positive and negative feedback loops (Tett & Burnett 2003) as particular
forms of dynamic interaction; otherwise, such mechanisms have not received attention to date.
Judge & Zapata (2015) identify trait effects on situations as targets for future meta-analytic
research.
Person–Workplace Fit
Seventeen sources discussed person–workplace fit in terms of traits, eight specifically in TAT
terms. As evident in the fit literature generally, fit was considered most often at the organizational
level and secondarily at the social (team, group) level. Klehe et al. (2014), for example, discuss the
evaluative implications of fit between individuals, teams, and organizations, and Dimotakis et al.
(2012) found that negotiators high versus low on agreeableness were a better fit in integrative
versus distributive exchanges, respectively. Notably, TAT integrates fit between the individual and
their job, supervisor, team, and organization. Further insights into TAT’s role in person–workplace
fit are offered by Tett et al. (2013) and at the end of this article.

Two sources suggested application of TAT to personality-oriented work analysis (O’Neill et al.
2013, generally, and Simonet et al. 2017, more specifically) to identify conditions affecting the
expression and impact of dark personality traits in work settings. Despite the availability of relevant
instruments (e.g., Raymark et al. 1997), researchers continue to rely on traditional work analysis,
job descriptions, ONET, and, in many cases, job titles in identifying locally relevant traits. This
seems a missed opportunity to capitalize on the advantages of trait-specific analyses as a refined
confirmatory strategy (Aguinis et al. 2009; Goffin et al. 2011; O’Neill et al. 2013; Tett et al. 1991,
1994, 1999).
Situational Taxonomies
TAT was cited with respect to situational taxonomies in two sources. In their meta-analysis of
situation trait relevance and situation strength effects, Judge & Zapata (2015) identified several
prominent situational factors based on TAT (e.g., attention to detail, independence), although the
list is far from complete. Connelly et al. (2017) suggested situational taxonomies would promote
trait–situation interactionist research. Such efforts are consistent with Tett & Burnett’s (2003)
suggestion that situation trait relevance offers a promising basis for organizing diverse situational
factors in ways directly germane to trait–situation interactions (see Parrigon et al. 2017).
Trait Specificity
Twelve sources considered trait specificity in trait–situation interactions, four with direct refer-
ence to TAT. Greenbaum et al. (2017), for example, found Machiavellianism facets (e.g., amoral
manipulation, desire for control) are differentially activated by abusive supervision in predicting
unethical conduct and, more specifically, social undermining. The major theme in all such sources
is that, consistent with prior reviews (e.g., Rojon et al. 2015, Rothstein & Goffin 2006), trait–
outcome linkages are stronger and more interpretable when based on narrow trait and criterion
pairings. Reliance on TAT for this purpose supports its use for advancing confirmatory strategies.
Team Building
Only two sources addressed issues relating to team building. Sung et al. (2014) used TAT to assess
how asymmetric dissimilarities in group members’ personality traits affect OCB and task per-
formance and how such effects vary over time. Hirst et al. (2011) urge organizations to exclude
avoidance-oriented workers from creative teams and to decentralize and deformalize team set-
tings, allowing learning-oriented and prove-oriented team members to flourish. Teams are com-
posed of multiple, typically interdependent members, each with their own personality traits and
KSAs varying in relevance to team tasks, roles, and norms. Accordingly, teamwork seems especially
rich in opportunities for trait–situation interactions. Whether TAT or some other interactionist
model might help frame such complexities remains largely unexplored (see Driskell & Salas 2013).
Complex Interactions
Seventeen sources considered interactions among multiple traits, eight relying closely on TAT
in modeling situational moderation. Schmidt et al. (2012), for example, found conscientiousness
predicts performance positively and CWBs negatively in groups with high core-group evaluations
and/or mean conscientiousness, whereas extraversion predicts CWBs positively in groups with
high mean extraversion. Simonet et al. (2017) report the interactive combination of narcissism

lower-level positions.
Performance Appraisal
Two sources used TAT to investigate the performance appraisal process. Harari et al. (2015) meta-
analyzed relations between evaluators’ FFM traits and performance ratings under various condi-
tions (e.g., field versus lab settings). Agreeableness proved the strongest predictor (mean ρ = 0.25
overall, 0.33 in field settings). Such efforts are beginning to explore the performance appraisal pro-
cess from an interactionist standpoint, but much remains unknown in this area. Halo bias seems
a particularly worthwhile target for TAT (Tett & Burnett 2003) as a function of mutual trait acti-
vation between raters and ratees.
Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities Activation
Seven sources cited TAT in support of KSA activation. For example, knowledge sharing was acti-
vated by coworker support (Lee et al. 2015) and extrinsic reward perceptions (Wang et al. 2012).
Farh et al. (2012) identified emotional displays in emotional labor situations as activators of emo-
tion perception skill. Extension of TAT to activation of KSAs and other variables (e.g., motives,
values) supports the generalizability of situation relevance beyond its application to mainstream
personality domains.
Complementary Theories
Of the 99 reviewed sources, 35 combined TAT with a total of 26 other theories in framing em-
pirical hypotheses and/or conceptual models. The three theories most commonly paired with
TAT (each in four studies) were those of leader–member exchange (LMX), social exchange theory
(SET), and PE fit. LMX theory (e.g., Dansereau et al. 1975) holds that leaders prefer followers of-
fering more favorable inputs (e.g., skills, motivation) to the exchange process. Runhaar et al. (2013)
used TAT to show how high LMX relationships constrain cues for work engagement expressed
as organizational citizenship behavior at the organizational level. As a foundation for LMX the-
ory, SET (e.g., Blau 1964, Gouldner 1960) holds that individuals engage others when the benefits
exceed the costs and reciprocate when receiving desirable exchanges (e.g., norm of reciprocity).
Haynie (2012) showed that exchange ideology (i.e., team–member exchange) activates core self-
evaluations in predicting team performance.
That the two theories most commonly paired with TAT focus on interpersonal exchanges
invites more formal integration along those lines. A possible link is mutual trait activation (Sung
et al. 2014, Tett & Murphy 2002), whereby one person’s trait expressions activate another’s traits.
Compatibility is expected when exchange partners bring out the best in one another and avoid
pushing one another’s buttons. The key units of exchange in this process are trait-based need
satisfaction, driving intrinsic motivation, and valued outcomes, driving extrinsic motivation. A
TAT rendering of LMX theory along those lines seems especially opportune.
PE fit theory (e.g., Kristof 1996, Kristof-Brown & Guay 2010) holds that workers are matched
to their work situations to the degree their skills and abilities meet work demands (demands–
abilities fit) and the organization meets the worker’s needs (needs–supplies fit). Bergman et al.
(2013) combined TAT with PE fit theory in proposing fit-driven organizational commitment de-
rives from activation of workers’ values by relevant work events. As noted by Tett et al. (2013), per-
sonality traits, unlike KSAs and values, contribute to fit via both needs–supplies and trait–demands
mechanisms, making them uniquely important constructs in PE fit.

Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Guest (guest) IP: 199.83.221.44 On: Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:06:33Theories paired with TAT in two sources include Locke & Latham’s (1990) goal-setting theory,
Mischel & Shoda’s (1995) cognitive–affective personality system, Holland’s (1997) vocational the-
ory, Kelley & Thibaut’s (1978) interdependence theory, Deci & Ryan’s (2008) self-determination
theory, and Bass’s (1985) transformational leadership theory.
The noted 35% of reviewed sources pairing TAT with companion theories is a marked in-
crease over the corresponding 7% of papers Tett et al. (2013) identified. This jump in theoretical
complementarity supports the flexibility of TAT as an integrative framework.
Trait Activation Theory Extensions
Several sources proposed construct- or process-focused TAT extensions. Regarding constructs,
several studies considered the situational relevance of predictors and criteria beyond the usual
personality and performance domains. Jung & Takeuchi (2014), for example, assessed LMX mod-
eration effects on relations between person–organization fit and work attitudes. Similarly, Neal
et al. (2012) considered differential trait activation effects on distinct performance facets (e.g.,
task proficiency versus adaptivity). Two studies examined situational moderators operating at the
level of national culture (Choi et al. 2015, Holtschlag et al. 2013), above the three levels origi-
nally proposed. Other studies examined psychological moderators, extending TAT principles be-
yond strictly situational moderation. Oh et al. (2014), for example, describe how self-monitoring
suppresses (i.e., constrains) expression of low agreeableness as individual-level counterproductive
work behavior.11 This type of effect is distinct from moderation by perceived situational factors
(e.g., judged LMX quality), which are psychologically mediated.
Expanding on TAT processes, a few sources (e.g., Bipp & Klienbeck 2011, Debusscher et al.
2016) advance states as short-term mediators of trait effects. Harris et al. (2016) add implicit trait
policies and job knowledge as moderators of situational effects on trait–performance linkages in
SJTs, further conditioning trait–outcome relationships. Building on the behavior/performance
distinction, Lievens et al. (2015) merge TAT with Funder’s (2012) realistic accuracy model in
showing AC construct validation requires recognition of elicited traits. Woods et al. (2013) sum-
marize findings suggesting habitual trait activation (over years) causes shifts in population trait
means, such that behavior affects trait standing. Similarly, Xu et al. (2014) offer case studies of
how leader traits “evolve” by experience throughout life (e.g., mischievousness in childhood be-
comes spirituality in later adulthood).
The noted expansions of TAT promote insight into how personality and related variables play
out in work settings as a function of situational and extended moderation. None challenges TAT
in any fundamental respect, and further research will determine their theoretical efficacy.
Personality Dynamics
Eight sources addressed personality–situation interactions in the context of dynamic personality
systems, six with explicit ties to TAT. Xu et al. (2014), for example, rely on TAT in advancing
a dynamic, “evolutionary” process of leader personality change, whereby “intrinsic” traits vary
in intensity and “extrinsic” traits are replaced based on the leader’s exposure to key situations and
events throughout the lifetime. Several papers apply TAT to personality states (e.g., Heidemeier &
Bittner 2012). More detailed analysis of how TAT might advance the study of personality dynamics
is offered in the second half of the current article, following review of empirical tests of TAT-
inspired moderation effects in work settings.
11 Such effects might be configured as trait-by-trait interactions. Classification by moderator type (constraint
in this case) captures the researcher’s portrayal in TAT terms.

MODERATOR EFFECTS
Of the 75 empirical articles explicitly grounded in TAT over the current review period, 60 (80%)
reported a total of 262 moderator effects. Results bear consideration in terms of (a) test frequen-
cies, showing how TAT has been applied in assessing moderators, and (b) percentages of those
tests that are statistically significant, showing where TAT has been successful. Regarding TAT
applications, Table 1 presents test frequency percentages and corresponding interpretations for
predictor categories (e.g., FFM traits), functional cues (i.e., moderator types), and operational
levels. Overall, TAT has been applied (a) at all three proposed levels and further to the broader
cultural level; (b) in terms of all six moderator types (most often demands, rarely releasers), and
(c) to a broad variety of predictors, including not only mainstream FFM traits but also KSAs and
other variables outside the core personality domain.
Speaking to the success of TAT moderation effects, Table 2 presents test frequencies and per-
centages significant per predictor category and functional cue, crossed with operational level.12
Frequencies for moderator types other than demands were too small in many cells to permit mean-
ingful interpretations. Accordingly, frequencies are provided per operational level for (a) demands
only (distracters in the case of neuroticism), (b) predictor categories collapsing across moderator
types, and (c) moderator types collapsing across predictor categories. Results are notable in several
respects.
First, the overall 60% significance rate is far above the nominal 5% Type I error rate, in support
of TAT-driven moderation of predictor–outcome linkages. Second, significance rates vary across
predictor categories (p < 0.05), ranging from 40% for compounds to 79% for emotional stability/
neuroticism. Corresponding rates based only on demands are similarly variable, ranging from
38% for compounds to 93% for emotional stability/neuroticism. At the task level, significance
rates are relatively high for openness: 74% collapsing across moderator types and 81% based on
demand effects alone. These results suggest emotional stability/neuroticism and openness may
be particularly sensitive to situational moderation. The most relevant moderator of emotional
stability/neuroticism relations is work stress. Stressors may be an especially salient and potent trait
activator. Demands for creativity may be similarly evocative of openness. Among the strongest
moderator effects in Judge & Zapata’s (2015) meta-analysis was that of demand for innovation
on openness–performance linkages. Differential range restriction and situation strength across
predictor classes is another possibility. Further study is needed to compare situational moderators
regarding their trait activation potential (Haaland & Christiansen 2002).
Third, significance rates are similar across operational levels (p > 0.50), ranging from 53% to
65%, in support of the multi-level structure of TAT and its noted expansion to national culture
(Choi et al. 2015, Holtschlag et al. 2013). Fourth, collapsing across operational levels and omitting
the two releaser cases, significance rates are similar across moderator types (p > 0.20). Thus, no
moderator type is more effective overall. However, for the 154 nonreleaser cases at the task level
(60% of all cases), significance rates do vary across moderator types (p < 0.05), ranging from 45%
for discretionary cues to 100% for distracters. As discretionary cues represent (trait-specific) weak
12 All significant cases reported here are in the direction predicted by the researchers. Few, if any, of these
hypothesized effects were assessed using one-tailed tests. Accordingly, reported hit rates may underestimate
moderation effects. Other factors to consider are the relatively low power of moderation tests (Aguinis et al.
2017) and possible inflation of significance rates due to publication bias. The latter factor may be counteracting
the first two to some degree.

majority (71%), consistent with TAT’s primary focus on trait
activators. Discretionary cues account for 13% of task-level cases,
suggesting notable reliance on TAT in modeling trait-specific work
autonomy. Releasers are rarely assessed, understandably given their

assessed at the national culture level, expanding TAT application
beyond the three levels originally described.

Motivation 28% (task), 59% (social) Consistent with social–cognitive models emphasizing the social nature
of work motivation (e.g., Farmer & Van Dyne 2010), motivational
variables were the only predictor type more commonly targeted at
the social level than the task level (χ2= 20.63, df = 1, p < 0.0001).
Remaining predictors 65% (task), 30% (social)

Demands 64% (task), 25% (social) Test frequencies for the six moderator types vary proportionately
between the task and social levels (χ2 = 38.42, df = 4, p < 0.0001).
Demands, facilitators, and discretionary cues (autonomy) were more
commonly targeted at the task level. Distracters and constraints
tended to be modeled more distally in the social context of work.
Distracters 38% (task), 52% (social)

situations, the lower hit rate for this moderator class supports Judge & Zapata’s (2015) meta-
analytic results favoring situation trait relevance over situation strength.
The main take-away is that the predictive and explanatory advantages of a given personal-
ity trait are conditional on conceptually relevant situational and psychological factors. The value
of personality traits, accordingly, should be assessed under trait-relevant conditions and will be
underestimated to the degree effects are undifferentiated on trait relevance (Tett & Christiansen

2007). Aggregating effects by broad job families and outcome classes (e.g., Barrick & Mount 1991,

ferentiates effects within those classes, affording greater precision in understanding how and why
personality is linked to valued outcomes. The effects of any trait, including conscientiousness, can

advance the study of personality dynamics.
TRAIT ACTIVATION THEORY AND PERSONALITY DYNAMICS
Researchers are increasingly turning their attention to within-person variability in understanding
personality as a dynamic system (Wille & De Fruyt 2014). Personality dynamics may be under-
stood as “theory based, testable processes mediating changes in an individual’s thoughts, feelings,
and behaviors in response to internal and external demands” (Tett & Fisher 2020). Focusing on
change over time adds complexity to the study of personality, beyond that conferred by trait–
situation interactions. Modeling such change is important in fully rendering personality effects in
work settings as dynamic systems.
Tett & Fisher (2020) identify five distinct but interrelated research lines on personality dy-
namics at work: (a) dispositional change (e.g., self-monitoring), (b) person–situation interactions
(i.e., situational specificity), (c) personality states, (d) personality and career development, and (e)
self-regulation (SR) approaches to work motivation. They also identify five key issues framed by
TAT relevant to within-person variability: (a) cross-situational consistency versus variability; (b)
the behavior/performance distinction; (c) interpersonal compatibility as a function of mutual trait
activation; (d) dynamic interaction, per positive and negative feedback loops; and (e) a need-based
motivational system (i.e., primary intrinsic reward from trait expression, secondary intrinsic
reward from knowledge of performance results, and differential preference for extrinsic rewards).
Below, each research stream is considered in light of each TAT issue as a 5 × 5 matrix, summarized
in Table 3.13 Mapping personality dynamics domains to TAT issues offers both an integration
of diverse lines of inquiry within a parsimonious theoretical framework and identification of
promising lines of research.
Trait Activation Theory and Dispositional Change
Tett & Fisher (2020) offer three examples of change-related dispositions. Neuroticism entails
volatility in negative emotions and reactivity to threats; adaptability entails modifying one’s be-
havior and maintaining composure in meeting variable, stressful demands; and self-monitoring
entails deliberate manipulation of one’s observable behavior in interpersonal encounters. Other
intrapersonal, change-related traits include functional flexibility (Lievens et al. 2018) and adven-
turousness. Traits targeting changes to one’s environment include charisma (changing others) and
proactive personality (changing work situations). Below, we detail how TAT might help advance
personality dynamics involving change-related traits.
TAT holds that behavior is consistent across situations only to the degree those situations are
similarly trait relevant (Haaland & Christiansen 2002, Tett & Guterman 2000). Change-related
dispositions should, accordingly, be evident over multiple change-related situations: Someone who
repeatedly modifies their actions to meet changing demands will be identified as adaptable or flex-
ible; one who routinely accommodates the interaction styles of diverse others will be seen as high
on self-monitoring. Because change is the target of observation, variable surface behaviors must be
distinguished from deeper dispositional consistencies (Dalal et al. 2020, Mischel & Shoda 1995).
Personality dynamics deals with more than surface-level variability; however, where characteristic
patterns of change are evident across similar situations, surface-level variability marks underlying
consistency in dispositional change.
13 Although Tett & Fisher (2020) set out both the five lines of personality dynamics research and the five TAT
issues, they did not discuss their intersection as offered here.

TAT separates behavior and performance for two reasons. First, it configures bidirectional
(i.e., positive versus negative) trait–performance linkages as trait-expressive behavior yielding op-
positely valued outcomes depending on work demands. Second, it isolates the role of observers
whose evaluations convert one to the other. Change-related traits play into those processes like
other traits: Flexibility may be positively or negatively related to observers’ evaluations of perfor-
mance per local demands (Lievens et al. 2018). More so than other traits, however, those focusing
on change have stronger intrinsic ties to outcomes. Self-monitoring, for example, entails adjusting
one’s own behavioral style to accommodate others’ styles, requiring active monitoring of the ex-
change partner as a source of feedback guiding adjustments. Flexibility similarly relies on feedback
as a basis for adjusting to changing demands. Understanding dynamic traits is especially reliant
on the behavior/performance distinction.
TAT suggests people are compatible when they provide one another opportunities to express
their traits in positively valued ways. Change-related traits lend themselves readily to this inter-
actional process. Over brief or lengthy periods, two neurotic coworkers might reciprocate in ele-
vating their negative affect, undermining work engagement and possibly their performance (each
serving, in TAT terms, as a distracter for the other). The two might prefer the calming (i.e., con-
straining) influence of a more emotionally stable teammate. And, where the neurotics heighten the
demand for stability, the preference may be mutual. The self-monitor feeds on change, each new
social encounter offering a fresh opportunity for accommodation. Change-oriented dispositions
add dynamic complexity to social interactions, and TAT can help model that complexity.

back loops. Two neurotics recursively triggering one another’s negative affect is understandable as
a positive feedback loop (with typically negative outcomes); positive feedback can also occur with
extraverts whose trait expressions invite further social engagement. Social interactions are prime
settings for feedback loops: Arguments escalate, negotiations settle, and brainstorming sessions
peak and subside. At a broader level, a Machiavellian leader might capitalize on organizational pol-
itics, promoting a culture with further opportunities for selfish manipulation. Proactive workers,
offering suggestions in a suitably supportive environment (C. Brown, unpublished information),
can stimulate further opportunity for change. Expressing any trait can alter future trait-expression
opportunities; change-based traits are especially generative in this respect.
TAT holds that trait expression is intrinsically motivational. Change-based dispositions, ac-
cordingly, should be especially motivating in dynamic jobs, groups, and cultures where cues for
change are abundant. TAT posits further motivation from extrinsic rewards contingent on trait
expression, especially when outcomes are trait aligned. Thus, the adventurous worker might be es-
pecially motivated by an opportunity for an overseas placement or extended travel. Other extrinsic
motivators relevant to those with change-related traits include increased learning opportunities
(i.e., through training) and new assignments, coworkers, and technology. Organizations are dy-
namic systems. Where jobs, teams, and cultures are especially dynamic, change-focused traits are
likely to play a more prominent role in worker motivation.
Trait Activation Theory and Person–Situation Interactions
Person–situation interactions are the main focus of TAT, making TAT applications to personality
dynamics in this respect somewhat redundant with earlier coverage. Going beyond the main thrust
of TAT, however, is recognition that, as situations change over time, so too does the relevance of
personality traits (Woods et al. 2013).
Behavioral variability across situations is, in part, a function of changing trait-relevant cues. At
one moment, a situation might call for attention to detail as an expression of conscientiousness,
and at the next, for creativity as an expression of openness. Tracking changes in behavior across
situations from a personality dynamics perspective calls for tracking of corresponding changes in
situational features affecting trait expression and its value.
Bidirectionality in personality–outcome linkages, evident between jobs (see Tett et al. 1999,
Tett & Christiansen 2007), can also occur within jobs. An agreeable team leader, for example,
might shine one minute in helping a deserving team member, but falter in the next, too easily
accommodating an unproductive loafer. Trait expression in this case remains constant, but the
value of that expression has changed. Should the agreeable leader manage an appropriately tough
response to the loafer, TAT predicts they will experience dissatisfaction (Christiansen et al. 2014).
Furthermore, if the demand for toughness becomes routine, the agreeable leader might seek a
more agreeable job (in both senses of that term). Behavioral consistency yielding variable per-
formance and behavioral variability yielding consistent but possibly dissatisfying performance are
predictable only by separating trait-expressive behavior from its value as performance.
Interpersonal relationships are fluid: The nature of a given dyad, group, or team evolves over
very brief to extended intervals. TAT offers to clarify the role of personality traits in team pro-
cesses by focusing on team chemistry in terms of mutual trait activation. A well-functioning team,
from a TAT perspective, is one where each member’s traits are aligned not only with being a
“team player” (Driskell et al. 2006) and with the team’s mission (e.g., task type) and their particu-
lar role on the team (e.g., leader, gate keeper, devil’s advocate), but also with their teammates’ traits
such that each member brings out the best in one another in contributing to the team’s success.

formed and were more satisfied than teams overloaded with dominant members. Humphrey et al.
(2007) report similar complementarity involving extraversion broadly. Change was not a key focus
in either study, but team outcomes seem likely to vary with changes in team member personal-
ity composition. Even with static team membership, evolving task demands can trigger different
traits, each creating demands, distracters, constraints, etc., for other members in a cascade of trait
activation, potentially affecting a variety of team processes and outcomes (see Driskell & Salas
2013).
Behavioral effects on situations are an especially dynamic part of TAT. Research on the pro-
posed positive (cue-increasing) and negative (cue-decreasing) feedback loops is only beginning
(Liguori et al. 2013, Sung et al. 2014). Operating in dynamic personality systems, such trait–
behavior–situation–trait loops can be extended between traits. For example, conscientiousness
successfully expressed as high performance may prompt recognition and social obligations rel-
evant to extraversion. Openness expressed as war correspondence could increase demands for
emotional stability. The possibilities for such cross-trait activation, especially at the facet level,
seem endless. Whether some chains are more common than others and under what conditions
(e.g., operational level) they emerge are questions for programmatic, longitudinal investigation.14
Need-based motivation can contribute to personality dynamics in light of situational complex-
ities in trait-relevant cues. Consider, for example, two friends competing for the same promotion
such that one’s personal success risks estrangement from the other. Here, the needs for achieve-
ment and power might be pitted against the needs for affiliation and approval. Further motiva-
tional input derives from trait-influenced perceptions of extrinsic rewards (e.g., increased pay).
How hard each friend competes for the promotion will be based, in part, on the net motivational
force each derives from need fulfillment if one versus the other is promoted. Now consider that
friend A offers B a hint of permission, partially satisfying B’s affiliative need, favoring the com-
petitive option. Alternatively, A might threaten B with the loss of friendship, thereby heightening
B’s affiliative need, favoring acquiescence. Other traits could be activated as well (e.g., aggres-
sion, autonomy), each contributing its own motivational force, depending on the individual’s trait
standings. Traits, as needs, are rudimentary motivational constructs, and motivational dynamics
calls for their consideration in light of the flux of trait-relevant cues.
Trait Activation Theory and Personality States
A key target of personality dynamics is personality states (e.g., Debusscher et al. 2016), which are
relatively brief thoughts and feelings giving rise to behavior in response to particular situations or
occasions. TAT was intended to model situational effects on trait expression, but it readily extends
to personality states. Whole-trait theory (Fleeson 2012, Fleeson & Jayawickreme 2015) models
relatively short-term fluctuations in personality states as density distributions of underlying dis-
positions. How might TAT advance such models?
TAT proposes that behavior is consistent across situations to the degree those situations are
similarly trait relevant and trait expressions yield similarly valued outcomes. Because states are
typically taken as indicators of intrapersonal variability, consistency in states across occasions is
14 The overall independence of the FFM dimensions suggests cross-activation may be equivocal at the broad
level; by the same token, correlated facets within broad dimensions may reflect cross-activation at the facet
level, e.g., detail orientation and achievement under conscientiousness, dominance and sociability under ex-
traversion, and empathy and nurturance under agreeableness.

trait-relevance principle, states might be expected to recur to the degree occasions are similarly
state relevant. Thus, states may be subject to the same basic activation processes involving traits,
but on shorter timelines, with traits setting stochastic limits on state variability (Fleeson &
Jayawickreme 2015).
TAT’s taxonomy of situational features seems applicable as well, as situations can include mo-
mentary demands, distracters, constraints, releasers, facilitators, and discretionary cues, each af-
fecting the generation and/or value of relevant states. States may be induced independently of
traits (e.g., Minbashian et al. 2010), but underlying dispositions increase the likelihood of corre-
sponding states. Thus, states are, to some degree, proximate mediators of trait effects that help
explain short-term within-person variability (Debusscher et al. 2016).
The separation of behavior and performance frames bidirectionality and performance judg-
ment relating to traits. It is of similar import in the context of states. Just as situational demands
triggering traits over longer durations help frame performance judgments (in terms of how well
demands are met), shorter-term demands eliciting states can frame judgments of momentary per-
formance (Debusscher et al. 2016). Bidirectionality, accordingly, is possible with states as with
traits (Heidemeier & Bittner 2012).
States offer considerable advantage in exploring the dynamics of interpersonal relationships.
Two people can be getting along until one triggers an insecurity in the other, which might then be
smoothed over by an apology or a vote of confidence. Such momentary shifts in behavior, affect,
and cognition require constructs more nimble than trait dispositions, whose effects are evident
across relatively long intervals where aggregation serves reliability and longer-term prediction
(Epstein 1979, Fleeson 2004). States offer the needed agility for dealing with moment-to-moment
variability in the quality of interpersonal exchanges, as short-term trait proxies.
The shortened timeline on which states vary lends itself to consideration of behavioral effects
on situations over brief intervals. Emotional contagion has been linked to emotional stability/
neuroticism: Those higher on neuroticism are more susceptible to negative emotion transfer and
those higher on emotional stability, to positive emotion transfer (see Barsade et al. 2018). These
effects can be understood as positive feedback loops in emotional stability/neuroticism activation,
leading to negative versus positive mood states (Sy & Choi 2013). Variables preventing or extin-
guishing contagion permit configuration in terms of negative feedback loops (e.g., positive affect
defusing negative affect contagion). Trait-based motivational states (Bipp & Kleinbeck 2011) also
permit configuration as feedback loops in dynamic interaction.
States, more so than traits, have affective content (Seo et al. 2004). Some states are pleasur-
able, others noxious. People willingly engage with situations and other people that evoke more
positive states and avoid those evoking more negative states. Also, behavior that expresses a given
state might be expected to be intrinsically motivating (i.e., cathartic), and expectations of positive
outcomes (e.g., a favorable reaction from a friend, a negative reaction from a rival) are also likely
to drive whether or not a state is acted on. Motivational processes involving states seem largely
parallel to those involving traits modeled under TAT, albeit operating on shorter timelines.
Trait Activation Theory and Personality and Career Development
Whereas personality states play out over very brief intervals, dynamic personality processes are
also evident on the scale of years, decades, and lifespans. TAT was not intended for application

Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Guest (guest) IP: 199.83.221.44 On: Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:06:33over such intervals. Here, we explore some possibilities regarding career dynamics, promotion,
and turnover, which occur over relatively extended timelines.
Consistent with evolutionary processes promoting survival and reproductive success, aging
brings with it increasing demands for ambition, responsibility, and leadership. Roberts et al.’s
(2005) social investment principle holds that age-dependent social norms drive upward popu-
lation shifts on conscientiousness, dominance, emotional stability, and agreeableness. Similarly,
Wille et al. (2012) reported normative trait shifts relating to career roles adopted over 15 post-
college years. Mean neuroticism, for example, decreased in those serving in director, presenter,
or inspirator roles. Woods et al. (2013) suggest such shifts may reflect habitual trait activation,
relevant to personality dynamics on the scale of populations spanning decades.
Targeting individual-level variability, Ng et al. (2005) report meta-analytic mean ρs for linkages
between promotion frequency and neuroticism (–0.11), extraversion (0.18), and proactive per-
sonality (0.16). From an interactionist perspective, these results suggest promotion opportunities
trigger avoidance in neurotic workers versus engagement in extroverted and proactive workers.
Zimmerman (2008) reports meta-analytic estimates of linkages between turnover and the FFM.
The strongest relationships are with agreeableness (mean ρ = –0.27), conscientiousness (–0.22),
and emotional stability (–0.20),16 suggesting workers are more likely to quit, in general, when
prone to fitting poorly with coworkers, work standards, and work stressors, respectively. Results
of both studies show a role for personality in within-person job change at a general level, but they
ignore effects involving individuals’ particular trait-based vocational preferences.
Holland’s (1997) RIASEC (realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, conventional)
model holds that job and career choices are an extension of personality: “people tend to act on
their dominant interests and seek occupations in which their interests can be expressed” (Holland
1996, p. 400). Consistent with this gravitational hypothesis, Judge et al. (1999) reported people
tend to work in jobs aligned with their personality traits (e.g., r between childhood extraversion
and social job employment = 0.20). Similarly, De Fruyt & Mervielde (1999) found college stu-
dents’ RIASEC interests and FFM traits predicted RIASEC-aligned job employment a year after
graduation. Extraversion, for example, correlated 0.35 with employment in enterprising jobs and
0.25 in social jobs. People take jobs for other reasons, most notably, to pay for life’s necessities,
and for other practical reasons (e.g., location, work schedule). Personality–job incongruence feeds
career instability (Holland 1996, 1997). As skills and fit opportunities improve over the lifespan,
stability increases (Gottfredson 1977). Holland’s interactionist model readily accommodates trait
activation in accounting for the dynamics of individual career trajectories.
Considering personality–performance relationships over time raises key issues regarding
separation of trait-expressive behavior and its value. Woods et al. (2013) note how performance
follows a learning curve, plateaus, then gradually declines (Zyphur et al. 2008) and how different
personality traits predict performance at different employment stages (Murphy 1989). Thoresen
et al. (2004) found openness and agreeableness predict sales performance improvement in the
early transition stage, when learning and networking are important, whereas conscientiousness
predicts in the later maintenance stage, when task goals matter more. Similarly, Lievens et al.
(2009) report bidirectional trait effects in a medical school setting, where extraversion predicted
early performance negatively and later performance positively. TAT offers two sources for such
16 These point-biserial correlations are corrected for range restriction, unreliability, and uneven splits on
turnover; they are not corrected for dichotomization per se. Accordingly, upper and lower limits are +/–
0.80. Estimates on the full +/– 1.00 correlation range may be derived by dividing reported estimates by 0.80
(e.g., –0.27/0.80 = –0.34).

given trait’s expression. Longitudinal study distinguishing those two mechanisms could shed light
on the dynamics of personality–performance linkages as a function of employment stage.
The Peter principle (Peter & Hull 1969) describes how top performers are promoted to posi-
tions where they fail. Success as a mid-level software engineer, for example, favors independence,
introversion, and detail orientation (Cruz et al. 2015). Management, in contrast, calls for coopera-
tion, assertiveness, and big-picture thinking (Acuna et al. 2006; see Smith et al. 1985). Transition-
ing from one to the next challenges fit. Benson et al. (2019) showed recently that companies tend
to promote their most productive salespeople to management and suffer net losses when they do.
Organizations fare better when promoting candidates with collaboration experience relevant to
managerial demands. Although not expressly about personality, this study shows how promotion
can turn strengths into liabilities. From a TAT perspective, the two jobs vary in opportunities for
trait expression and/or the value of those expressions (i.e., demands in one may be distracters in
the other). Separating trait expression from its value as performance offers insight into the Peter
principle from an interactionist standpoint.
Research on the role of interpersonal compatibility in career advancement is limited. Munyon
et al. (2015) reported meta-analytic linkages between political skill, defined as “interpersonal savvy
and style” (p. 144), and the FFM and various work outcomes. Notable mean ρs were obtained with
extraversion (0.48), agreeableness (0.28), conscientiousness (0.24), emotional stability (0.23), and
career success (i.e., income and position level; mean ρ = 0.27). Extraversion, the strongest corre-
late of political skill, is a driver for advancement (e.g., Costa & McCrae 1988). The other three,
agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, identify Digman’s (1997) “socialization”
factor, labeled “stability” by DeYoung (2006). Putting all this together from a TAT perspective, ad-
vancement opportunities are cues for extraversion, and being high, in addition, on agreeableness,
conscientiousness, and emotional stability contributes to political skill fostering a favorable rep-
utation as a socialized, stable, and humbly ambitious promotion candidate (Munyon et al. 2015).
Zimmerman’s (2008) mean ρ of –0.27 between agreeableness and turnover, noted above, affords
a comparable interpretation in the direction opposite promotion. More direct tests of trait-based
interpersonal compatibility in career dynamics await investigation.
Countering situationist claims that behavior is dictated by situations, Schneider (1987) argued,
“the people make the place.” A leader’s disposition, for example, can drive organizational culture,
which, in turn, influences worker behavior via company policies and reward structure. This is
consistent with dynamic interaction in TAT, whereby trait expression affects the availability of
further trait-relevant cues.
Changes in leadership demands across the business life cycle offer an extension of such feed-
back loops. Lippitt & Schmidt (1967) describe three stages of an organization’s life cycle, each
with its own concerns: birth (creation, viability), youth (stability, reputation), and maturity (adapt-
ability, societal contribution). The relevance of leader personality traits might be expected to
change as the organization grows. From a TAT perspective, traits operating successfully in ear-
lier stages could decrease demands for those traits later on. Zhao & Seibert (2006) report meta-
analytic standardized mean differences between entrepreneurs and managers on several traits,
including achievement (δ = 0.59), openness (0.36), and neuroticism (–0.37). To the degree the
entrepreneur/manager distinction tracks transitions along the organization life cycle, these dif-
ferences support dynamic interaction: Achievement, openness, and emotional stability (i.e., low
neuroticism) successfully engaged during start-up move the organization to a stage with reduced
demands for those qualities. Longitudinal tracking of leaders’ trait-relevant demands (distracters,
constraints, etc.) operating at different levels across organizational life cycles would more directly
illuminate dynamic personality effects in the workplace.

Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Guest (guest) IP: 199.83.221.44 On: Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:06:33Trait-based work motivation spanning careers and lifespans is most readily consolidated in
terms of person–workplace fit. The theory of work adjustment (Dawis & Lofquist 1976, 1984)
identifies adjustment as “the continuous and dynamic process by which the individual seeks to
achieve and maintain correspondence with his or her work environment” (Dawis & Lofquist 1976,
p. 55). Work situations are differentiated by their “occupational reinforcers,” which are conditions
that satisfy the worker’s needs (Dawis & Lofquist 1975). Holland’s (1997) RIASEC model similarly
suggests individuals are drawn to and motivated by occupations that align with their personality
and interests (Sullivan & Hansen 2004). Schneider’s (1987; Schneider et al. 1995, 1998) attraction–
selection–attrition (ASA) model holds that people are attracted to, selected into, and stay with or
leave an organization based on personality similarity. All those models, like TAT, frame worker
motivation based on fit. TAT expands on this idea in several ways.
First, TAT emphasizes traits as needs (Murray 1938). The theory of work adjustment (Dawis
& Lofquist 1984) considers needs as bases for work values more so than traits (Hansen 2013).
Satisfying needs through trait expression, per TAT, is intrinsically rewarding (i.e., pleasurable;
see, e.g., Smillie 2013). Second, adopting basic behaviorist principles, TAT adds motivational force
from extrinsic rewards contingent on performance and further conditions that motivation on the
degree to which reward type is relevant to the worker’s traits (differential reward preference).
Distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic motivation sets up the possibility of conflict between them:
Fit is especially poor where cues abound for negatively valued traits. Third, TAT identifies three
levels of situational features offering opportunity for fit: task, group, and organizational. Finally,
TAT suggests performance feedback should be especially motivating to those high on achievement
striving. All told, TAT holds that career dynamics, punctuated by turnover and promotions, are
a function of the individual’s long-term pursuit of a job in which they are rewarded for being
themselves.
Trait Activation Theory and Self-Regulation
SR denotes “processes involved in attaining and maintaining (i.e., keeping regular) goals, where
goals are internally represented (i.e., within the self ) desired states” (Vancouver & Day 2005,
p. 158). Motivation derives from the gap between targeted and current selves, operationalized
by the goal–performance discrepancy (Lord et al. 2010). Similar to traits, goals are activated by
situational input, but through schema-driven processes (Carver & Scheier 1990).
Dispositions are secondary to cognitive mechanisms in SR models, albeit important in some.
They are invoked most often in terms of goal orientation [i.e., mastery, performance approach, per-
formance avoidance (VandeWalle 1997; see Donovan et al. 2013)], but other traits, too, including
conscientiousness (e.g., Diefendorff et al. 1998, Roberts et al. 2005), anxiety (Kanfer & Heggestad
1997), and impulsivity (Shah et al. 2002). Promoting a broad interface between personality traits
and SR processes, DeYoung’s (2015) cybernetic Big Five theory identifies the FFM dimensions
specifically in terms of their relevance to goal-driven motivation. Conscientiousness, for example,
drives prioritization of long-term goals over immediate gratification, extraversion drives sensitiv-
ity to rewards, and neuroticism, sensitivity to threats. Given this cursory introduction to SR and
relevant traits, let us explore how TAT might be incorporated into SR theory.
SR theory targets variability in two main respects: Changes in task demands trigger SR pro-
cesses by introducing or altering goals; furthermore, the individual adjusts effort, attention, and
direction of behavior to close the gap between targeted and current selves (Lord et al. 2010). Over-
laying this essentially universal process (i.e., applicable to everyone), dispositional tendencies (i.e.,
personality traits) can affect the trajectory of that process (DeYoung 2015, Hooker & McAdams
2003). Achievement-oriented people tend to set harder performance goals (Seijts et al. 2004) and
try harder to meet goals (Barrick et al. 1993), impulsive individuals are more easily distracted

Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Guest (guest) IP: 199.83.221.44 On: Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:06:33from their goals (Shah et al. 2002), and anxious workers tend to orient performance away from
the task, toward the self (Simpson et al. 2001, Vancouver & Tischner 2004). Given (a) SR is fo-
cused on variability in situational inputs, behavioral outputs, and cognitive–affective mediators and
(b) personality traits predispose behaviors affecting relations among those variables, then (c) un-
derstanding what activates, constrains, releases, and facilitates relevant dispositions and the levels
at which such factors operate (task, group, organization) advances understanding of within-person
variability in work motivation through a SR lens (Donovan et al. 2013).
SR theory, as with TAT, clearly distinguishes behavior from performance, offering several
points of comparison between the two theories. First, performance in SR is goal attainment,
whereas in TAT it is behavior that meets work demands. Goals, although similar to demands,
are cognitive constructs, whereas demands are external work features. Second, performance feed-
back is fundamental to SR (e.g., DeShon et al. 2004); in TAT, it is expected to be especially salient
to those higher on achievement striving. Third, the distinction offered in TAT as a basis for ex-
plaining bidirectional trait–performance relationships has similar application in SR. Hoyle (2006)
notes impulsivity tends to undermine goal processes but is sometimes beneficial (Dickman 1990).
SR models expand opportunity for bidirectionality by articulating mediated pathways to perfor-
mance. Bipp & Kleinbeck (2011), for example, found participants higher in neuroticism had lower
expectancy but higher goal commitment on a difficult task. Fourth, TAT also separates behavior
and performance to invite consideration of the active role of performance judges. To our knowl-
edge, SR models neither consider this [as distinct from the active role of supervisors in the goal-
setting process (e.g., Lord & Brown 2004)] nor preclude it. All told, TAT and SR are compatible
by their separation of behavior and performance, albeit with different emphases and applications
of that distinction.
Morf (2006) noted in the context of SR that “the self is completely contextualized in the so-
cial environment with which it is constantly engaged” (pp. 1530–32). Narcissists devalue others
whose higher performance is perceived as threatening (Morf & Rhodewalt 1993), and workers
higher on dependency anxiously reject well-meaning attempts by others to promote their auton-
omy (Bornstein 2005). In TAT terms, others’ successes are a distracter for narcissism, and with-
drawal of support is a distracter for dependency. As with TAT, SR has rarely been applied to the
study of workplace relationships [as distinct from SR understood as operating in a social context—
e.g., goal contagion (Aarts et al. 2008)—see Liu et al. 2015 for an exception]. Hoyle (2006) sug-
gests such SR applications “require the thoughtful integration of temperament, personality, and
information-processing constructs in such a way that traits can be understood in terms of pro-
cess and processes can be understood as expressions of traits” (p. 1516). TAT is well positioned to
advance SR approaches to understanding interpersonal relationships along those lines.
Lord et al. (2010) describe SR as a negative feedback loop in which goal-directed behavior nar-
rows the goal–performance discrepancy, decreasing motivation. Conversely, in a positive feedback
loop, a widening gap increases motivation. This is similar to the negative and positive feedback
loops in TAT, whereby a given trait’s expression reduces or increases further activation. The dif-
ference is that the gap in Lord et al.’s model is cognitive and self-based, whereas in TAT, cues are
aspects of the situation. The two pairs of feedback loops are not interchangeable, but neither are
they incompatible. Dispositions operating on SR pathways might promote or inhibit further trait
expression. Unchecked impulsivity, for example, could create a cycle of distraction, each rabbit
hole leading to another. Narcissists, ironically, create conditions that hamper their future success,
triggering further self-embellishment (Morf 2006). Generalized self-efficacy might also operate
on a positive loop, but with more favorable outcomes. Achievement striving serving goal comple-
tion may be on a negative loop in the short run but on a positive loop over longer intervals if early

dispositions seem primed to accommodate dynamic trait–situation interactions framed by TAT.
Motivation is the raison d’être of SR, whereas in TAT, it is a driver of trait-based situational
engagement as a foundation for person–workplace fit (Tett et al. 2013). The theories differ further
in the nature of motivation they prescribe. In SR, motivation derives from the current–ideal-self
discrepancy. Positive affect (i.e., satisfaction) ensues from closing the gap, and negative affect, from
corresponding threats. Motivation in TAT derives primarily from need satisfaction (Christiansen
et al. 2014, Murray 1938), whereby trait expression is inherently satisfying.17 Further satisfaction
may derive from knowledge of results, especially where success satisfies the need for achievement,
and from extrinsic outcomes, especially those aligned with relevant traits.
Notably, affect is the fundamental common denominator of motivation in both theories. SR
theories positing dispositions as moderators (including DeYoung’s cybernetic theory) offer no ra-
tionale for why such dispositions are engaged except in service to reducing the goal–performance
discrepancy. Traits such as impulsivity impede discrepancy reduction, and it is unclear what mo-
tivational mechanism might derive from SR to explain its engagement. From a TAT perspective,
responding impulsively to opportunities for distraction provides the impulsive worker intrinsic
satisfaction from need fulfillment.18 To the degree impulsivity undermines performance, satisfac-
tion from trait expression will conflict with others’ negative reactions and associated outcomes.
Thus, a job with many distractions offers an especially poor fit to someone high on impulsivity.
By the same basic process, jobs with clear, challenging goals offer good fit to workers high on
conscientiousness; those with goals requiring positive, active social engagement offer good fit to
those high on extraversion, and so forth.
There is no reason in principle why cognitive, self-based discrepancies and trait-based needs
cannot coexist in a hybrid SR–TAT motivational system. Each motivational process contributes
uniquely to work motivation. Furthermore, both reduce to affect, driving approach and avoidance
responses to the environment, in turn, serving fit in the immediate timeframe and, ultimately,
survival and reproductive success.
SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Trait activation theory was offered as a call to action in furthering predictive gains from personal-
ity in light of identifiable complexities in trait–situation interactions, and this aim, on the whole,
appears to have been met. Our review of the TAT literature spanning 2011 to 2019, extending
Tett et al.’s (2013) review, suggests person–situation interactions, situational specificity, and situa-
tion trait relevance are increasingly recognized as critical in understanding the role of personality
at work. Further recognized are the ideas that such interactions play out at multiple levels (task,
group, organization, and, recently, national culture), through mechanisms involving trait-specific
work demands, distracters, constraints, releasers, and discretionary cues, and, in some cases, with
motivational impact of traits as needs. The theory has been used to advance understanding of
those and various related topics, including person–workplace fit, personality-oriented work anal-
ysis, team-building, performance appraisal, trait-specific work autonomy, trait and criterion speci-
ficity, behavioral effects on situations (i.e., dynamic interaction), complex interactions involving
17 Neuroticism works a little differently than other traits (Costa & McCrae 1988) by motivating threat avoid-
ance (e.g., DeYoung 2015). Neurotics do not enjoy feeling worried, angry, and depressed, but they enjoy re-
ductions in those feelings when neuroticism-driven avoidance diminishes precipitating cues.
18 Notwithstanding any negative consequences, impulsive people enjoy jumping from one thing to the next.

KSAs, motives, values), and complementary theories. Significance rates for theory-driven mod-
erator tests provide overall support for situation trait relevance and for TAT as a generative and
integrative framework.
Mapping TAT onto the personality dynamics literature shows opportunity to extend applica-
tion of TAT-framed interactionist principles in advancing understanding of within-person vari-
ability in terms of change-focused dispositions, person–situation interactions, personality states,
career paths, and SR motivation models. Corresponding literatures offer varying support for such
applications (e.g., emotional contagion, the Peter principle, ASA), but much more is possible. We
close our review by highlighting five synergistic research vectors where TAT seems most likely to
yield predictive and theoretic gains.
Personality-Oriented Work Analysis
It is approaching 30 years since Tett et al. (1991) reported notably stronger personality validity
estimates based on job analysis as a refined confirmatory strategy. Personality-oriented work anal-
ysis has been advanced (e.g., Raymark et al. 1997) with overall success (e.g., Aguinis et al. 2009,
O’Neill et al. 2013), and most prominent personality tests have companion work analysis instru-
ments. Yet, relatively few empirical studies have leveraged such tools to identify traits especially
likely to predict under local conditions (Goffin et al. 2011). The call for trait-based work analysis is
a timely one, not only in support of local validation (e.g., for selection) but also programmatically
in studies of personality dynamics, where trait-relevant cues shift over varying timescales, acti-
vating and deactivating traits within and among individuals, and affecting complex motivational
processes with diverse behavioral and affective outcomes. Now, more than ever, we need measures
to track the cues, constraints, and facilitators operating at multiple levels as conditions affecting
when and how targeted traits (and states) are expressed in valued ways.19
Longitudinal Studies of Personality Processes
Increased reliance on personality-oriented work analysis complements the need for longitudinal
investigation of the person–situation relationship as a two-way street (Wille et al. 2014): Situ-
ations trigger traits affecting situations relevant to the actor and others over minutes (e.g., ne-
gotiations) to decades (career paths). Time introduces unique situational factors, including cue
stability, modulation (e.g., daily routines, seasonal markets), and density (e.g., cues per minute). It
elevates the importance of states and time-related traits, such as endurance, impulsivity, and con-
servatism, and offers points of comparison among task, social, organizational, and national levels,
operating on successively extended timelines. Recognizing time-linked factors on both sides of
the person–situation linkage creates unique opportunities for interactions from a dynamic, longi-
tudinal perspective.
Within-Job Bidirectionality
Bidirectionality of trait–outcome linkages between jobs is well established (Tett & Christiansen
2007). Its occurrence within jobs is less clear, but few traits have universally positive or negative
expressions even within jobs. People are hired to meet dominant work demands, but how do they
deal with the distracters? Can a positive predictor of one performance dimension (e.g., budget
19 Meyer et al. (2014) introduced a measure of situational strength, showing moderation of personality rela-
tionships with OCB and CWB due to differential situational strength, independently of trait relevance.

weakly related to overall performance (due to cancelation of positive and negative effects), and
is this practically equivalent to where trait-relevant cues are lacking altogether? Are curvilinear
relationships more likely where strong demands operate at both poles of the trait? How do workers
navigate conflicting demands operating at different levels (task, group, etc.)? Do traits such as
self-monitoring and functional flexibility help in this respect? Is job crafting the active promotion
of demands and reduction of distracters relevant to one’s traits, moderated perhaps by proactive
personality? TAT provides a suitably articulated frame for viewing these and related questions
through an interactionist lens.
Trait Activation in Teams
Teams are dynamic systems (e.g., Salas et al. 1992). TAT identifies four distinct opportunities for
differential trait effects in team settings: (a) team orientation (being a “team player”) in meeting
overall team-driven demands to engage and help teammates (extraversion, agreeableness), meet
commitments (conscientiousness), and adapt to change (emotional stability, openness); (b) team
task types (e.g., interdependence increasing demands for cooperation and agreeableness; a think
tank, for creative thinking); (c) team member roles (e.g., leadership increasing demands for
dominance; devil’s advocate, for assertiveness); and (d) team member relationships as mutual
trait activation serving both complementary (e.g., dominance/submissiveness) and supplementary
(e.g., sociability/sociability) fit. Traits activated in one respect may affect trait expressions and their
value in another. TAT can help manage such complexities in teamwork involving dispositions,
related states, and other variables (e.g., KSAs, values) by reliance on a common set of principles,
including situational relevance, dynamic interaction, and need-based motivation.
Person–Workplace Fit and Situational Relevance
The common target of all major strategies in work psychology is person–workplace fit, yielding
both performance and worker well-being (Tett et al. 2013). Applying TAT to traits, KSAs, and
values operating at multiple levels promotes integration of fit under common principles. KSAs
meet task demands as complementary fit serving performance and operate similarly at the social/
team level. Conversely, values are targets of supplementary fit with culture and climate at the
organizational level serving positive work attitudes (e.g., job satisfaction) and operate similarly at
the social/team level. Personality traits operate at all three levels: Meeting task demands in com-
plementary fit serves performance, matching organizational characteristics in supplementary fit
serves positive work attitudes, and both complementary and supplementary fit at the social/team
level serve performance and positive attitudes. Tying together all those fit variants is the principle
of situational relevance, the heart of TAT. TAT-based personality-oriented work analysis tuned
to trait-specific demands, distracters, etc., operating at multiple levels (task, social, etc.) and
engaged over time in longitudinal designs promises to improve trait-based prediction of valued
outcomes, set boundary conditions on generalizability inferences, and expand our understanding
of personality and companion constructs in the workplace and beyond.
EPILOGUE
Such is the state of the trait activation literature spanning 2011–2019, with a view to new appli-
cations in the emerging domain of personality dynamics and some especially promising projec-
tions of the situation trait-relevance principle. At the broadest level, this review confirms what

matter, particularly regarding the role of personality at work, is less straightforward. TAT, so far,
appears to offer both an integrative and generative framework for advancing programmatic re-
search into person–situation interactions serving both practical and theoretic aims. Its future seems
bright; time will tell.
