citation: "Lofland, J., & Stark, R. (1965). Becoming a World-Saver: A Theory of Conversion to a Deviant Perspective. American Sociological Review, 30(6), 862-875."

annotation: "Presents a value-added model of conversion to deviant religious perspectives through seven sequential conditions: tension, religious problem-solving perspective, seekership, turning point, cult affective bonds, neutralized extra-cult bonds, and intensive interaction."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The conversion process involves multiple interconnected actors (individuals, cult members, family), stages (predisposing conditions, situational contingencies), and relationships (affective bonds, extra-cult attachments, interaction patterns) that form a complex network best represented as nodes and edges in a property graph structure."
