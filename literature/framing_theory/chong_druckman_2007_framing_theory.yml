model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "Property graph model best captures the complex theoretical framework with nodes representing key concepts (frames, considerations, attitudes, values) and edges representing the processes and relationships between them (framing effects, psychological mechanisms, moderating factors). The theory involves multiple interconnected constructs with various types of relationships including causal processes, moderating effects, and conceptual distinctions."
