annotation: "Presents poliheuristic theory as a two-stage decision-making framework where leaders first use cognitive heuristics to eliminate alternatives based on the avoid-major-political-loss principle, then apply analytical calculations to select from remaining options. Includes the Poliheuristic Procedure for systematic analysis of foreign policy decisions."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "Property graph model best captures the complex network of relationships between decision-makers, alternatives, dimensions, calculations, and outcomes. The theory involves multiple interconnected entities (leaders, decisions, alternatives, dimensions) with various relationships (eliminates, evaluates, influences) that form a comprehensive decision-making network structure."
