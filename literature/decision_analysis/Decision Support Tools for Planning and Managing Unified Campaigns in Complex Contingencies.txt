Intervention is not about totally defeating
the opponent (a Nation-State or
Decentralized Networked Threat)
Its about transferring power from a
hostile regime to a friendly and
democratic regime using all forms of
national power available

consequences and effects

 Automatically forces models to interact to suggest
plausible activities and outcomes
 Allows bi directional and multi sided analysis

Phase 1 Results
• Human-machine interfaces, particularly the visualization capabilities, must
be able to be tailored to the role of the user
• Extant technologies for modeling PMESII systems are abundant and
sufficient
• A hierarchy of models is needed
• Generic models provide users with insight into trends but not specific
guidance
• Detailed, in-depth models, instantiated to portray real people, places,
organizations etc., are preferred to develop plans
• The family of interacting models produces large numbers of suggested,
plausible outcomes which is often difficult to understand
• A suite of loosely coupled models is difficult to employ - when the
environment is partitioned, the interactions between partitions are difficult
for the human to determine
 Visualization techniques which reduce the dimensionality of data are
essential for understanding the complexity of the outcomes that can be
generated by models.
