Abstract
Understanding why people do what they do is central to advancing equitable
and sustainable futures. Yet, theories about human action are fragmented
across many social science disciplines, each with its own jargon and implicit
assumptions. This fragmentation has hindered theory integration and ac-
cessibility of theories relevant to a given challenge. We synthesized human
action theories from across the humanities and social sciences. We developed
eight underlying assumptions—metatheories—that reveal a fundamental or-
ganization of human action theories. We describe each metatheory and the
challenges that it best elucidates (illustrated with climate change examples).
No single metatheory addresses the full range of factors and problems; only
one treats interactions between factors. Our synthesis will help researchers,
policymakers, and practitioners gain a multifaceted understanding of human
action.

1. INTRODUCTION
Understanding human action is recognized as essential for addressing today’s linked social, eco-
logical, and climate crises (1–5). Yet, theories that seek to explain human action are diverse and
numerous and stem from many disconnected academic disciplines. Each of these disciplines and
subdisciplines is underpinned by its own set of (often implicit) assumptions and (often esoteric)
vocabulary (e.g., 6). Such inaccessibility has hindered the development and application of human
action theories to address today’s crises (e.g., climate change). Moreover, the few theories that have
been widely used are often applied beyond the contexts in which they are valid and informative
(7). A map that organizes human action theories is therefore crucial for advancing sustainability
(including all of its components, e.g., social justice, biological conservation, climate action, envi-
ronmental protection, and human and planetary health).
The isolation of human action theories among disjunct disciplines has hampered scholars in
navigating the full range of theories to find those that suit a given case. Consequently, scholars
are forced to select the most familiar off-the-shelf theory in their discipline or the theory widely
used by colleagues (e.g., 8, 9). Familiar explanations for human action are tenacious: When one is
presented with unexplained human action, “the tendency is to commission further studies in the
same mold. This results in a self-sustaining paradigm” (10, p. 1276), which may prevent broader
investigation of human action. For example, the theory of planned behavior (a psychology theory
that posits that individual behavior is determined primarily by one’s perceived control over one’s
own behavior and intentions; 11) is often applied to nature conservation, although it may often
be unsuitable (7). Studies have shown that, while this theory is useful for predicting individuals’
short-term, intended, and self-reported actions in constrained decision spaces, it is unlikely to
predict human action more broadly (7, 12). Therefore, the theory is most relevant to a narrow set
of problems. Similarly, many other theories are also most relevant for particular contexts, actions,
and problems (9). The numerous challenges that require transformative change (13, 14)—rather
than short-term, marginal, individual changes—might best be addressed by a wider array of human
action theories.
Fragmentation of theories across disjunct disciplines has also constrained expectations about
what a solution will look like. For instance, popular theories of behavioral economics, including
nudge theory, target behavior change by shifting individual decisions that are often semiconscious

or driven by heuristics (15). For example, public transportation ridership might be boosted by
automatically bundling bus passes with vehicle registration fees (making bus pass purchases the
default). However, since nudge theory targets semi- or unconscious individual behavior, reliance
on this approach omits and may impede attention to crucial institutional and systemic constraints
(1). Indeed, a focus on individual behavior overlooks the key role that transformative structural
change plays in sustainable trajectories (1, 10). As the adage goes, if you have a hammer, problems
look like nails. Increasing the accessibility of the many theories that target both individual and
structural features (i.e., providing access to more of the toolbox) could hasten the understanding
and adoption of solutions to a wide variety of social–environmental problems.
Increasing access to human action theories could also facilitate fertilization across disciplines,
likely resulting in more robust and situationally relevant theories. For example, autonomy (the
degree of ownership over one’s actions) plays a central role in self-determination theory (a theory
from educational psychology that seeks to explain intrinsic motivation; 16). But autonomy is ab-
sent in another theory, the extended parallel process model (a communications theory that seeks to
explain how fear messages affect health-related behavior; 17). Should autonomy also be included
in the extended parallel process model? Or is there something about the context of health-related
behavior that makes autonomy unimportant? Without engaging across theories, we cannot dis-
criminate between these explanations, nor can we create more robust and relevant theories.
Previous reviews of human action theories have often been limited to a subset of theories, such
as those relevant to individual behavior (18, 19) that is consciously intended to better the environ-
ment (i.e., proenvironmental behavior; 20) or to individual decisions about energy consumption
(21). Important theories about collective action and structural change are thus often overlooked.
Even ostensibly full-spectrum reviews have employed search terms and analytic methods that im-
plicitly restrict disciplinary scope. For example, Davis et al. (22, p. 332) assert (per their discipline)
that a good theory must show “the independence of constructs from each other.” While many
theories in psychology exemplify this criterion, theories in other disciplines do not. For instance,
this criterion excludes practice theories in which each cultural and physical element is inextri-
cably linked to others, using interdependent variables (e.g., technology and meaning interact in-
terdependently to determine water consumption; 23). Other reviews have usefully summarized
many relevant theories, but without synthesizing or investigating underlying assumptions (e.g.,
24), which diminishes the potential for integration.
To integrate these productive but disjunct areas of work, we analyzed 86 representative and
prominent theories of human action from across the human and social sciences. We cast a wide
net by including any theory that sought to explain human action, free from constraints related
to discipline or assumptions. By inductively characterizing each theory, we developed eight core
metatheories (or underlying assumptions) that represent and differentiate all of the original 86 the-
ories. The metatheories we developed transcend academic disciplines and provide a fundamental
yet simple organization of human action theories. We describe each metatheory and suggest the
types of problems each would best elucidate, including illustrative examples of how each metathe-
ory might be harnessed to address climate change.
2. METHODS
2.1. Defining Human Action Theories
We defined a human action theory as a description of the relationship between human action
and a set of variables. Our definition is broader than that used in previous studies in four key
ways. First, we included not only theories but also models and frameworks (25). Second, we did
not require theories to identify unidirectional relationships between input/independent variables
www.annualreviews.org • Review of Human Action Theories 727
Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Guest (guest) IP: 199.83.221.44 On: Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:40:16Dependent variables:
treated as being at least
partially determined
by other measured
variables. In traditional
models, variation in an
independent variable
explains variation in a
dependent variable
(e.g., rising CO 2 levels
explain the rise in
global temperature)
Grounded theory:
inductive identification
of commonalities of
and differences
between different
elements (in our case,
theories), from which
one can then distill
organizing categories
(in our case, e.g.,
metatheories)
Positionality:
the social, cultural,
relational,
environmental, and
political position in
which a person exists
in relation to a given
topic, project, or world
and outcome/dependent/response variables. Although other reviews have limited their scope to
such one-way relationships (e.g., 26), this assumption excludes many theories from anthropology
and sociology, which often use interdependent variables. Third, we included both academic books
and papers (compare 22) since different fields rely on different publication formats. Fourth, we
intentionally theorized “action” instead of “behavior.” Behavior often refers to actions by fully
independent individuals and dominates psychology (e.g., 18, 19, 27), but this term is rare in other
disciplines. We therefore theorized “action” because it has fewer disciplinary constraints.
2.2. Selecting Human Action Theories
We harnessed multiple methods to collect diverse and representative human action theories. We
searched Web of Science with (“theory” OR “model” OR “framework”) AND (“behavior” OR
“action” OR “practice” OR “intention” OR “movement” OR “motivation” OR “change”) AND
(“human” OR “social” OR “person” OR “people”). We also conducted targeted searches covering
the social science disciplines identified by Reference 28, followed reference chains/used snowball
sampling, and consulted with scholars about the dominant human action theories in their respec-
tive disciplines. Of these theories, we selected those that appeared seminal or typical of a set of
similar theories. This selection process produced 86 theories (see Table 1).
2.3. Categorizing Human Action Theories
Our approach was “grounded”: We inductively identified commonalities between theories and
then distilled axes from these commonalities (rather than presupposing the axes that organize
theories; 145). This method produced five axes: (i) academic discipline, (ii) unit of action (e.g.,
individual, collective), (iii) type of action (e.g., volitional behavior), (iv) explanatory logic (i.e.,
whether the theory was meant to describe action or change action), and (v) sets of foundational
assumptions underlying each theory (i.e., metatheory; 146, 147).
We iteratively and inductively categorized all theories along each axis. Specifically, we assigned
each theory to an initial category, then combined initial categories into higher-level categories
(i.e., focused coding; 145). After creating this preliminary categorization of all theories, we rean-
alyzed and recategorized each one (i.e., asked new questions of each theory; 145). Some theories
were included in multiple classes (i.e., fuzzy coded). To identify academic discipline, we drew on
a combination of author affiliation, journal affiliation, self-identification, and disciplinary jargon.
We illustrated our categorizations, using the R package circlize version 0.4.13 (148). We
calculated the fourth root of the number of times each theory’s key source was cited to display the
relative citations each theory had received. This measure is only approximate, since theories differ
in age, number of sources, and associated citational norms.
Categorization is useful but necessarily imperfect and, at times, arbitrary (149). Our emer-
gent categories are neither objective nor preexistent but reflect one inductive characterization
and synthesis (145, 150). Our characterization of human action theories may reflect our
own positionalities as interdisciplinary scholars; the first author, who led the coding, is a White
man with broad interdisciplinary training and research in the human and social sciences, as well
as in ecology and evolution.
3. MANY DISCIPLINES REPRESENTED
Our analysis of 86 theories of human action (Table 1) revealed a vast range of topical foci, but also
underlying commonalities. Our findings show the breadth of disciplines theorizing about human
action and (uneven) cross-fertilization between them (see Figure 1). Psychology, neuroscience,

and economics showed substantial overlap, while psychology and anthropology showed little
(Figure 1). Overall, psychological theories were less interdisciplinary than those in most other
disciplines. This literature suggests an extensive basis for scientists and practitioners to study
and enable sustainable action. However, academic discipline was insufficient to organize human
action theories or define underlying drivers of human action.
4. EIGHT METATHEORIES: DESCRIPTION AND APPLICATION
Our eight emergent and synthetic metatheories represent the baseline assumptions that underlie
all 86 theories (Figure 2). Such metatheories inform “. . .the sorts of questions one asks and does
not ask. . .” (146, p. 98). Metatheories thus dictate which explanations researchers look for: If a
human takes action X, the causes could be either Y or Z or innumerable others. By limiting the
causes to Y or Z, metatheories constrain the types of questions asked, the answers obtained, and the
implications of these answers (146). However, which metatheory underlies a given theory is often
implicit to both theory-creators and theory-users (147, 151). This implicitness hinders integration
of multiple theories (6, 152). Explicating and relating implicit metatheoretical assumptions may
help organize, compare, use, and build better theories.
We labeled the eight metatheories developed through our inductive analysis as Independent
Self, Independent Structure, Cognitive Needs, Psychological Needs, Communal Needs, Eco-
nomic Needs, Interdependent, and Top-Down. Each of our eight emergent metatheories assumes
that a different set of factors generates human action (Figure 3) and thus enables understanding
of a distinct aspect, scale, and cause of human action (Figure 4). For example, as elaborated below,
our Independent Self metatheory assumes that independent personal attributes, such as attitudes,
shape individual short-term action (Figure 3).
4.1. Independent Metatheories
The first two metatheories, Independent Self and Independent Structure, treat the drivers of
human action as largely independent. The factors that shape human action are assumed to be
independent from each other and from any external factors; these external factors are assumed to
be unchanging.
4.1.1. Independent Self. The theories in our first metatheory, Independent Self, treat indi-
vidual behavior as shaped by personal characteristics, such as values, attitudes, traits, beliefs, and
worldviews, all of which are treated as independent of and unaffected by “external” context and
structure (10) (Figure 3). Personal characteristics are assumed to cause behavior (unidirectionally);
these theories do not examine how behavior in turn shapes personal characteristics (bidirection-
ally). Moreover, although theories may occasionally allude to structural factors, these are not the
primary focus of investigation. For example, the model of ecological behavior includes how behav-
ior can be enabled or disabled by external, infrastructural, and economic factors. However, these
external factors are treated obliquely or as contextual information and are not theorized to sub-
stantially affect personal attributes (104). While Independent Self theories can explain individual
short-term choices, they have been criticized for psychologizing social problems—that is, treating
a problem as solely a result of individual actions (153). This limited role of structural explanations
distinguishes the Independent Self metatheory from the Independent Structure and Top-Down
metatheories.
This category was prevalent, particularly in psychology, economics, and ethics (see Figure 5),
and contains many of the most widely cited theories, including the theory of planned behavior and
prospect theory (Figure 2). These theories are used to both describe and change human action,
primarily in relation to individual behavior and decision-making (Figure 4).

Figure 3
Simplified diagram showing the structure of each metatheory. Each metatheory makes different assumptions about what drives human
action: Particular components (blue, tan) are theorized to determine some conception of human action (yellow), which may satisfy
particular purposes (orange). Each metatheory draws on a different set of factors: The top two metatheories focus on the independent
self and structure, respectively. Each of the next four metatheories focuses on a different set of needs, including cognitive needs,
psychological needs, communal needs, and economic needs. The seventh metatheory examines often hidden, systemic factors; the final
metatheory examines how multiple factors, and action itself, interact to cocreate a practice. Our analysis reveals which metatheories may
be most appropriate for different types of solutions, from incremental, fast, and cheap to systemic and transformative (see Figure 4).
4.1.1.1. Action suitability. Theories in the Independent Self category are suited to provide
short-term, fast, small changes to deliberate behavior (see Figure 4). Because these theories as-
sume that context and structures are static, they are best applied to populations in which everyone
experiences similar context and structures and in which those structures are not changeable at the
scale of interest (e.g., tomorrow’s dietary choices in a school cafeteria). Thus, such theories are
less appropriate for more substantial and cascading changes, such as transitioning to a degrowth
economy (154). The Independent Self metatheory is often the default metatheory and so may be
overused (10); before employing these theories, potential users should verify that this metatheory
is the most appropriate.
4.1.1.2. Example application: climate change. Independent Self theories could tackle green-
house gas emissions by making small changes to intentional individual behavior of a homogeneous
population. For instance, this metatheory could instruct how to modify employee attitudes about
the health benefits of bicycle commuting, which might incentivize employees who own bicycles
to commute by bicycle more frequently. However, because this metatheory is best suited for

tinkering within existing systems, if the existing system is inadequate, then this metatheory is
unlikely to have much effect. For example, employees may have a positive attitude towards bicycle
commuting, but if the only route to work is on a busy highway, attitude modification may not
increase bicycle commuting.
4.1.2. Independent Structure. Our Independent Structure metatheory is analogous to the In-
dependent Self metatheory, but it assumes that independent structural factors, rather than personal
factors, drive action. Independent Structure theories assume that differences in cultures, educa-
tion, learning environments, institutions, infrastructure, and structures drive human action; inter-
nal processes and personal characteristics are often unexamined. For example, according to the
collective action theory in organizations, available information technology (e.g., email) influences
how people can communicate and carry out collective action.
Independent Structure theories were quite scarce among our sampled theories (Figure 2) but
were represented in multiple disciplines, including geography and sociology (Figure 5). These
theories are used primarily to understand how to change the action and management of collectives
and institutions (Figure 4).

assumptions that cut across theories and disciplines.
4.1.2.1. Action suitability. This grouping of theories addresses challenges that, relative to other
metatheories, require moderate-term, moderately fast, medium-scale changes (see Figure 4). This
metatheory accounts for structural changes, but not for feedbacks (as in positive feedback loops)
or interactions among structural factors and personal attributes. Consequently, this metatheory is

not suited to characterizing transformative, cascading changes. Nevertheless, it typically contains
clear structural intervention points, streamlining its application.
4.1.2.2. Example application: climate change. Independent Structure theories could lower
greenhouse gas emissions by explaining how to modify an institution or structure while holding
everything else constant. For example, these theories might propose to increase biking by creat-
ing separated bicycle lanes and bicycle garages. However, if people are not otherwise equipped
or able to bicycle (due to a lack of, e.g., knowledge to navigate traffic, ability to bicycle up a hill,
or experience adjusting gears), this change may be inadequate because this metatheory does not
integrate personal characteristics such as biking knowledge or attitude.
4.2. Needs Metatheories
Across the next four metatheories, a person’s action is theorized as directed towards an ultimate
purpose.
4.2.1. Cognitive Needs. In theories categorized under our Cognitive Needs metatheory, the
ultimate purpose of action is survival/evolutionary fitness, which results from the satisfaction of
any need associated with the cognitive processing of information (Figure 3). These theories thus
assume that human action is directed towards fulfilling cognitive needs. Among our theories, we
distilled four such needs: accurate inference (to ensure that decisions reflect reality), cognitive
efficiency (to ensure that limited energy resources are used to maximal effect), information ex-
ploitation (i.e., coasting/predictability; to ensure maximum utility of limited information), and
information exploration (to accurately adjust to changing and unfamiliar environments). These
cognitive needs are treated as fundamental, universal human needs necessary for survival.
According to theories in this category, cognitive needs are often connected with particular cog-
nitive processes. Information exploitation and cognitive efficiency are associated with heuristic
processing: unconscious, immediate processing that privileges current knowledge and peripheral
information (i.e., thinking fast; 114, 140, 155). Conversely, accurate inference and information
exploration are associated with systematic processing: slow, energy-intensive processing that priv-
ileges the content of new information (i.e., thinking slow; 114, 140, 155).
Cognitive Needs theories were moderately common among our human action theories
(Figure 2), primarily within economics, psychology, ethology, and neuroscience (Figure 5). Such
theories seek to describe and modify individual action and decision-making (Figure 4).
4.2.1.1. Action suitability. Cognitive Needs theories are appropriate for addressing challenges
that require short-term, moderately fast, medium-scale changes (see Figure 4). This metathe-
ory is particularly suited for facilitating quick and cheap changes (e.g., through “nudges”) (156),
although it can apply to longer-term changes (157). Because this metatheory makes use of univer-
sal cognitive needs, it may be appropriate for changing the action of heterogeneous populations.
Moreover, the metatheory typically contains clear choice intervention points, streamlining im-
plementation. However, supported changes are at the individual level and will likely not address
underlying so-called wicked problems (158). In addition, the apparent ease of implementing this
metatheory’s solutions may distract from addressing problems at their root (158). Nonetheless,
Cognitive Needs metatheory may offer an opportunity for making deeper changes when the in-
fluenced individuals are powerful (see examples in Reference 126).
4.2.1.2. Example application: climate change. Cognitive Needs theories could instruct how to
harmonize cognitive needs with green behavior to lower greenhouse gas emissions (Figure 4).
For example, a solution could take advantage of the cognitive need for efficiency by making it

arrange to make an appointment or go anywhere).
4.2.2. Psychological Needs. According to theories in our Psychological Needs metatheory, the
ultimate purpose of human action is to produce subjective well-being, which results from the satis-
faction of psychological needs. Human action can thus be understood as directed towards fulfilling
these psychological needs (Figure 3). Among our theories, we distilled six such needs: relatedness
(our most prevalently theorized need; the need to belong to secure relationships), pleasure pro-
motion (the needs to explore and approach enjoyable experiences, to self-actualize, and to seek out
and understand novel arenas), pain prevention (the need to manage and avoid painful experiences),
competence (the need for efficacy and an important feature of “flow” activities; 159), consonance
(the need for consistency, including with values; for the world to make sense; and for stable self-
identity), and autonomy (the need for ownership over one’s actions, i.e., internal perceived locus
of causality; 160). Pleasure promotion and pain prevention are similar to the cognitive needs for
information exploration and information exploitation, respectively (81). However, we categorized
these needs into different metatheories because they are theorized to advance different purposes:
psychological well-being versus survival (81, 119, 126). Moreover, while Cognitive Needs theories
target more unconscious needs, Psychological Needs theories center on experienced psychological
states. Nevertheless, both sets of theories treat needs as foundational, universal, and unchanging.
Psychological Needs theories were more numerous than any other metatheory (Figure 2).
These theories stem primarily from psychology but also from many other disciplines, including
evolutionary biology, sociology, communications, and management (Figure 5). With a focus on
elevating subjective well-being, this metatheory explores individual behavior change, motivation,
well-being, and compliance.
4.2.2.1. Action suitability. Psychological Needs theories are flexible and appropriate for ad-
dressing a variety of challenges, ranging from short term to long term and from incremental to
transformative. For instance, needs for relatedness and competence can be leveraged to shift be-
havior incrementally towards social norms (161). Recent work has also explored how such indi-
vidual actions might scale up to produce transformative change (162). Furthermore, relatedness
and pleasure promotion can be harnessed to develop transformative environmental movement
leaders (76). The concept of relational values—preferences, principles, and values associated with
relationships—has also recently been proposed to leverage the need for relatedness towards sus-
tainability (although this value concept also has similarity to the Interdependent metatheory; 163,
164). Psychological Needs theories also typically describe mechanisms for increasing human well-
being, which may result in more stable and resilient changes (125). Furthermore, because Psycho-
logical Needs theories treat needs as universal, they may be appropriate for changing the action
of heterogeneous populations. However, by externalizing structure and assuming that people are
largely the same, Psychological Needs theories may miss key drivers of human action.
4.2.2.2. Example application: climate change. Psychological Needs theories might be ap-
plied to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by harmonizing psychological needs with green action
(Figure 4). For example, a solution might redesign infrastructure and institutions to facilitate peo-
ple taking collective action consistent with underlying but latent environmental values (13, 165),
thus leveraging needs for both relatedness and consonance.
4.2.3. Communal Needs. Communal Needs theories are united by an assumed ultimate pur-
pose of social cooperation (e.g., collaboration, collective action, effective governance), resulting

article that assumes
that the ultimate
purpose of action is to

well-being (i.e.,
utility). Unlike the
subjective well-being
of Psychological
Needs, this well-being
is objective, reflecting
the utilitarianism of
Jeremy Bentham and
John Stuart Mill
from the satisfaction of communal needs (Figure 3) within particular institutions and cultures.
Communal needs are variable and can parallel psychological and cognitive needs, but we define
them as those that are assumed to enable social cooperation, rather than survival or subjective
well-being. For example, narrative theory suggests that collective action perceived as spontaneous,
rather than bureaucratic, can spur action by meeting communal needs for independence (108).
This communal need is similar to the psychological need for autonomy (16, 125), but while psy-
chological needs and cognitive needs are usually treated as universal and culturally independent,
communal needs are treated as (a) being more specific to the particular type of cooperation, cul-
ture, or institution and (b) enabling communal cooperation rather than individual well-being. For
example, narrative theory makes this cultural specificity explicit: “. . .narrative’s dependence on a
limited stock of culturally resonant plots—on a canon—emphasizes the constraints levied by dom-
inant cultural understandings” (108, p. 142; emphasis in original).
Our Communal Needs metatheory was relatively uncommon among our human action theo-
ries (Figure 2). This metatheory was most prevalent in sociology but was also found in marketing,
Indigenous studies, political science, and education (Figure 5), where it was used to understand
how to create cooperation and collective and institutional action.
4.2.3.1. Action suitability. This metatheory is appropriate for institutional challenges that re-
quire long-term, moderate to transformative changes (Figure 4). This metatheory helps make
institutions and groups more cooperative and successful through the satisfaction of communal
needs, such as equity and ownership (61). When one is confronted with a cooperation or collec-
tive management problem, this metatheory is most suitable. Furthermore, most of the represented
theories provide clear prescriptions for how to intervene. However, entrenched power structures
may prevent the satisfaction of communal needs or may limit the power of such groups.
4.2.3.2. Example application: climate change. This group of theories is appropriate for helping
groups organize, encourage participation, and bolster the collective adoption of new practices
(Figure 4). For example, this metatheory might be used to adapt to climate change by building
groups that can organize in anticipation of climate disasters, such as rising sea levels. Specifically,
a Communal Needs theory could show how to instill feelings of ownership and independence
within a climate activist group to enhance its effectiveness and grow its membership.
4.2.4. Economic Needs. Economic Needs theories share the assumption that the ultimate pur-
pose of action is to maximize utilitarian well-being (i.e., utility). Unlike the subjective well-being of
Psychological Needs, this well-being is objective, reflecting the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham
and John Stuart Mill (166). In this conception, well-being necessarily results from making choices
that satisfy preferences (167), rather than referring to a particular subjective state, as in Psycho-
logical Needs (168). This metatheory thus treats humans as rational utility maximizers (utility is a
measure of satisfaction to an individual) with preferences that dictate their choice of various alter-
natives (Figure 3). Preferences are typically assumed to be exogenous: independent of markets,
choice architecture, and context. In this independence, the Economic Needs metatheory is similar
to our Independent metatheories.
Our Economic Needs metatheory was relatively uncommon as an explicit theory among our
scientific human action theories, although it may underpin many public policies and associated
frameworks (169). This metatheory was widely adopted in economics, law, and criminology
(Figure 5), where it was exploited to understand how to modify individual behavior and decision-
making. Although focused on individual action, this metatheory is concerned with how these
individual actions scale up to collective action. Our economic needs metatheory thus often treats
individuals as undifferentiated and substitutable.

human action
4.2.4.1. Action suitability. This metatheory is appropriate for implementing rapid, marginal
changes within the dominant socioeconomic systems of many nations. A key benefit of Economic
Needs is its clear prescription of interventions (e.g., change prices or incentives). However, if the
problem stems from the system itself, this metatheory’s prescriptions may be insufficient (70, 170,
171). Furthermore, the well-being, preference, and valuation components of this metatheory have
likely been applied more widely than is appropriate, given its restrictive assumptions (72, 172–175).
4.2.4.2. Example application: climate change. Economic Needs theories might be applied
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by changing marginal costs and benefits. For example, this
metatheory might propose subsidizing bicycle or electric vehicle prices or initiating a carbon
tax. However, Economic Needs theories are ill suited to fundamentally address climate change
when political economic systems are themselves built on assumptions of nature domination, in-
strumental use, endless growth, and corporate power (170, 171). Like Independent Self theories,
Economic Needs theories are likely overapplied. Given the systemic nature of the climate–
ecological–inequity crisis, Economic Needs theories alone are unlikely to generate lasting
solutions. Nevertheless, they have a role to play in tackling numerous smaller-scale problems.
4.3. Top-Down Metatheory
Theories in our Top-Down category expose the often hidden, implicit systemic causes of human
action. From cultural systems of patriarchal domination to anthropocentrism (33), this metathe-
ory examines the largest and most systemic drivers of human action. Top-Down theories posit
that personal characteristics and individual actions result from a range of top-down factors, such
as culture, beliefs, economic systems, political systems, and wealth distribution. This causation is
assumed to be largely unidirectional: Top-down factors are rarely treated as influenced by indi-
vidual actions, in contrast to our Interdependent metatheory. Top-down is similar to Indepen-
dent Structure, except the former examines higher-level and more dominant (i.e., hegemonic)
structures.
Top-Down was less represented than other metatheories (Figure 2). These Top-Down theo-
ries stem primarily from critical scholarship within political ecology, critical geography, feminist
studies, and sociology (Figure 5). These theories are used primarily to understand how to change
societal and institutional action (Figure 4).
4.3.1. Action suitability. Top-Down theories are appropriate for large systemic problems that
cannot be solved by incremental changes within a system. However, while this metatheory is use-
ful for identifying underlying systemic issues (32, 170, 176) and imagining transformational fu-
tures, theories within rarely prescribe the specific interventions necessary to achieve transforma-
tive change. Thus, Top-Down theories are most appropriate for identifying sustainable futures
and the underlying factors preventing their realization, but other metatheories (such as Psycho-
logical Needs and Communal Needs) may be more effective for determining how to achieve said
sustainable futures.
4.3.2. Example application: climate change. Top-Down theories might be applied to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by identifying the systemic factors that have generated the current
climate crisis and impeded its resolution. For example, our metatheory might identify nature
domination, instrumental use, endless growth, and corporate power that undergird our current
political-economic system (177). Other metatheories might then be marshaled to determine how
to reform or overturn these systems, such as through social movements (102, 108).

experiences, meanings,
institutions, cultures,
politics, etc. In turn,

by human action itself
4.4. Interdependent Metatheory
Interdependent theories treat human action as continually created, reinforced, or eroded by an
interdependent web of values, identities, positions, habits, goals, needs, experiences, meanings, in-
stitutions, cultures, politics, etc. In turn, this interdependent web of factors is continually created,
reinforced, or erased by human actions (96, 178). For example, this metatheory assumes that peo-
ple’s actions might be influenced by their position in society (e.g., as poor or stigmatized within the
dominant cultural milieu), even while those people might act to challenge or resist those norms
or to innovate social alternatives that become new norms over time. Thus, the key characteris-
tic of this metatheory is the codeveloped interdependency of the constituent factors and the ac-
tion (10, 179–182). Our Interdependent metatheory thus differs starkly from other metatheories,
which assume that input/independent variables cause (but are not in turn caused by) changes in a
dependent/response/outcome variable.
Our final metatheory was moderately prevalent (see Figure 2), found primarily within sociol-
ogy and anthropology but also in critical race studies, Indigenous studies, feminist studies, science
and technology studies, and others (Figure 5). Theories within this category generally focus on
understanding accustomed, habitual, or accepted ways in which people do things, at the scale of
communities and regions (i.e., practice).
4.4.1. Action suitability. This group of theories is appropriate for addressing challenges that
are complex, uncertain, and interlinked. While all other metatheories focus on isolated drivers of
human action, this metatheory investigates interactions among multiple drivers. Interdependent
theories treat values, needs, structures, and systems as dynamic and are therefore well positioned
to expose causes of human action that may be taken for granted. While explicitly embracing feed-
backs, interactions, and the attendant uncertainty, however, this metatheory rarely provides clear
prescriptions for change or predictions of outcomes. Furthermore, the lack of quantitative focus
among Interdependent theories has prevented precise analyses of particular interactions. These
issues challenge the operationalization of Interdependent theories. Wider scientific and policy
engagement with this metatheory might help address these challenges.
4.4.2. Example application: climate change. Interdependent theories might inform how to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by simultaneously and adaptively changing the factors underly-
ing human action (183). For example, one might cultivate the practice of bicycle commuting with
a multipronged focus on competence (e.g., by providing bicycle classes and bicycle repair work-
shops, positive feedback, support from friends, or incentives to try bicycle commuting at least
once), availability (e.g., by promoting a free citywide bicycle share program and ample bicycle
racks at popular locations), meanings (e.g., by associating bicycle commuting with responsibility
for the environment and care for others who depend on the environment), and technology (e.g.,
by prioritizing street design for cyclists, not cars). As this example demonstrates, Interdependent
theories may describe more complicated interventions. Nevertheless, such descriptions may en-
able sustainability scholars and practitioners to appreciate the full range of possible factors and to
prepare for uncertainties. Once the salient interactions are understood, other metatheories may
aid in implementation.
5. KNITTING THEORIES TOGETHER
We inductively developed eight metatheories that underlie theories of human action. Each
metatheory examines different factors and makes different assumptions about the causes of
human action. Despite such differences, each metatheory is true in a sense, reflecting a particular
slice of human action. For example, the Independent Self metatheory asks how proximate,
www.annualreviews.org • Review of Human Action Theories 741
Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Guest (guest) IP: 199.83.221.44 On: Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:40:16personal attributes might affect human action. In contrast, the Cognitive Needs metatheory asks
how evolutionary goals of survival shape human action. These distinct questions define different
aspects of human action in different situations. Given the central role that human action plays in
social and environmental changes (184) and solutions (e.g., behavioral wedges; 5), our findings
may help scholars steer towards better outcomes by leveraging a broader array of theories.
Advancing sustainable futures—in reference to, e.g., environmental and social health and
justice—is complex and includes many overlapping and interlinked human action contexts (13).
Ultimately, most grand challenges facing society cannot be answered by a single theory or schol-
arly approach, but rather by a strategic combination of several complementary approaches. Chang-
ing human action is recognized as a chief aspect of addressing such challenges. For example, the
United Nations’ integrative environmental report, Making Peace with Nature, recognized that “[a]ll
[collective and individual] actors have a role to play in the transformations needed to achieve a
sustainable world” (185, p. 133).
Despite the breadth of action and actors, too often only narrow sets of theories are leveraged
for application. For example, the Global Biodiversity Outlook 3 report describes many types of hu-
man action that are necessary, including taking both “. . .direct action to conserve biodiversity. . .”
and “full advantage of opportunities to contribute to climate change mitigation. . .” (186, p. 86).
However, the report relies solely on the Economic Needs and Independent Self metatheories to
enable biodiversity conservation. Specifically, the report relies heavily on a combination of pric-
ing and fiscal policies (Economic Needs) and education and dissemination of scientific knowledge
(Independent Self ) (186). The assumption seems to be that people are independently selfish (con-
trary to the Psychological Needs and Communal Needs metatheories) and that larger economic
systems are best left intact (contrary to the Top-Down and Interdependent metatheories). While
both the Economic Needs and Independent Self metatheories may provide important insights into
addressing the biodiversity crisis, relying on only two of the eight metatheories would constrain
conservation efforts.
Those of us studying and working to enable environmental and social health might do well to
look beyond theories that seem to suit narrowly defined problems. Rather, we might use multiple
theoretical lenses—representing diverse metatheories—to grasp the ways in which other disci-
plines and scholars understand human action, the nature of the evidence consulted, and the ap-
plicability of their theories and findings. Adopting trans-, multi-, and interdisciplinary research
programs, knowledge, communication, networks, and funding structures will be essential to ad-
vancing and applying human action theories (187, 188); indeed, one might apply our human action
theories to a study of how to increase interdisciplinarity. Some interdisciplinary theorists have be-
gun to profitably incorporate multiple metatheories (e.g., 41, 77). Specifically, Tadaki (41) uses the
Psychological Needs, Independent Structure, and Interdependent metatheories to understand the
actions of New Zealand water regulators. Our synthesis provides an accessible starting place for
scholars and practitioners to develop interdisciplinary fluency.
Most theories found assume a simple independent–dependent variable relationship (seven of
eight metatheories). This widespread assumption omits feedbacks and interdependent relation-
ships that are crucial to systems analysis and sustainability (189, 190). Including feedbacks, as
the Interdependent metatheory does, is particularly important, as pandemics, climate change, and
other threats highlight nonlinear and complex environmental relationships.
Our analysis of human action theories is preliminary. While we sought to include a wide range
of disciplines and publication formats, search engines are such that we may have been more likely
to undersample from disciplines that often publish in books (such as anthropology and other dis-
ciplines that focus on culture) rather than in journals (such as psychology). Moreover, our analysis
did not include human action theories from history, literature, and some other arts and fine-arts

action is more obliquely stated (but still important). We also excluded folk and layperson under-
standings of human action (192) and undersampled from theories published in non-English (193)
and Indigenous accounts of why people do what they do (e.g., 112). Broadening the scope of anal-
ysis is an important future direction. Finally, as noted above, our metatheories are products of
academic work, which has long prioritized a focus on cognition, social structure, and culture as an
explanation for human action, at the exclusion of still-emerging possibilities.
6. CONCLUSION
While human action is indisputably at the center of pressing global crises, relevant theories are
splintered across disciplines with little communication among them. Fundamental assumptions
vary among these disciplines, impeding the interpretation of findings between disciplines and cre-
ative cross-fertilization. Our preliminary identification of eight synthetic metatheories enables
scholars and practitioners to navigate among these theories to select theories appropriate in dif-
ferent contexts and at different spatial and temporal scales. Only a synthetic understanding of
human action can yield robust and multifaceted insights into why people do what they do and
how that might change or be changed.
SUMMARY POINTS
1. No single set of human action theories is sufficient to address the range of problems
obstructing sustainable futures.
2. Eight sets of assumptions—i.e., metatheories—represent and differentiate human action
theories.
3. These metatheories transcend academic disciplines and provide a simple yet deep orga-
nization of human action theories.
4. Each metatheory is best suited to a particular type of problem.
5. Sustainability solutions may be most effective when they combine insights from multiple
metatheories.
6. Our analysis reveals that most theories assume a simple independent–dependent vari-
able relationship. This widespread assumption prevents the inclusion of feedbacks and
interdependent relationships that are crucial to systems analysis and sustainability.
7. Feedbacks are particularly key, as pandemics, climate change, and other threats highlight
nonlinear and complex environmental relationships.
FUTURE ISSUES
1. Future research could test how different metatheories might complement each other to
provide more robust solutions to real problems. Do solutions that incorporate multiple
metatheories lead to better outcomes?
2. How prevalent are applications of different theories and metatheories? Future research
might test the dominance of various theories and metatheories in particular fields, ap-
plications (e.g., biodiversity conservation), reports (e.g., those of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change), and institutions (e.g., the US criminal justice system).

Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Guest (guest) IP: 199.83.221.44 On: Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:40:163. History, rhetoric, international relations, and many other fields in the arts contain explicit
and implicit assumptions about human action but fell outside the scope of this review.
How do assumptions from these fields map onto our metatheories?
4. How do layperson assumptions about human action and nongovernmental organization
theories of change map onto our metatheories? A better understanding of how science
and scientific knowledge of human action fit into the cultures and worldviews of laypeo-
ple and institutions is an important area for future research.
