annotation: "Reviews challenges in modeling and simulating human behavior for policy analysis, proposing a biopsychosocial framework for authentic behavioral representation in contrast to current 'supersoldier' approaches. Introduces RAND's Will-to-Fight Model as a systematic approach to understanding disposition to act."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "Property graph model best captures the complex interconnections between individual psychological traits, physiological states, social relationships, and environmental factors that influence human behavioral disposition. The framework represents nodes as entities (agents, traits, factors) and edges as relationships and influences between these components."
