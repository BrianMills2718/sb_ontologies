annotation: "Comprehensive framework for understanding information disorder through three types (mis-, dis-, and mal-information), three elements (agents, messages, interpreters), and three phases (creation, production, dissemination). Integrates communication theory, cognitive psychology, and social media studies to explain how false information spreads and influences public discourse."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The information disorder framework is inherently relational, involving complex interactions between agents, messages, and interpreters across multiple phases. A property graph model best captures the multi-directional relationships between actors (agents, interpreters), information objects (messages), processes (creation, production, dissemination), and contextual factors (platforms, audiences, motivations). The model accommodates the dynamic nature of information flow and the recursive feedback loops where interpreters become agents."
