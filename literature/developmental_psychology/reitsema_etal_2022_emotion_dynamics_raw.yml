annotation: "Meta-analytic review examining emotion dynamic patterns in children and adolescents using ecological momentary assessment data from 102 studies with 19,928 participants. Analyzes developmental differences in emotional intensity, variability, instability, inertia, differentiation, and augmentation/blunting across childhood and adolescence, comparing typically developing youth with those having mental or physical health problems."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "Property graph model is most appropriate as the emotion dynamics framework represents a complex network of nodes (emotional states, developmental stages, population groups, measurement constructs) connected by edges (developmental trajectories, associations with psychopathology, measurement relationships, temporal dependencies). The theoretical framework involves multiple interacting components including emotion types, dynamic patterns, age groups, and health conditions that form a interconnected system of relationships."
