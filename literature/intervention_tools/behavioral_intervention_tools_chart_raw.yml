annotation: "A systematic evaluation framework that presents information and ratings on the technical rigor of studies examining behavioral intervention programs for students. The chart evaluates study quality across multiple dimensions and provides effect size data, serving as a tool for educators and families to select evidence-based behavioral interventions."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The Behavioral Intervention Tools Chart represents a complex network of relationships between interventions, studies, evaluation criteria, and outcomes. A property graph model best captures the interconnected nature of intervention programs (nodes) connected through various relationships including study evaluations, quality ratings, effect sizes, and target populations. This structure allows for comprehensive representation of how different interventions relate to study designs, evidence quality levels, target behaviors, and educational contexts."
