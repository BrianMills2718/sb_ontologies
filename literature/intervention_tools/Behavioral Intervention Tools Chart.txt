Behavioral Intervention Tools Chart

This tools chart presents information about behavioral intervention programs. The following four tabs include information and ratings on the technical rigor of the studies: (a) Quality of Design & Results, (b) Quality of Other Indicators, (c) Program Information, and (d) Additional Research.

The chart includes information and ratings on the quality of research studies about different interventions, not ratings on the interventions themselves. The ratings are about study quality only. Additional columns on the chart describe the effect sizes, or results, for those studies. Users are expected to review the study quality ratings and effect size information together when interpreting the chart.

The presence of a particular tool on the chart does not constitute endorsement and should not be viewed as a recommendation. All tools that meet the criteria for review are posted on the chart, regardless of results. The chart represents all tools that were reviewed, not those that were “approved.”

The National Center on Intensive Intervention publishes this chart to assist educators and families in becoming informed consumers who can select behavioral interventions that best meet their individual needs.

The Center's Technical Review Committee (TRC) on Behavioral Intervention independently established a set of criteria for evaluating the scientific rigor of studies demonstrating the efficacy of behavioral intervention programs. The TRC rated each submitted study against these criteria but did not compare it to other studies on the chart. The presence of a particular program on the chart does not constitute endorsement and should not be viewed as a recommendation from either the TRC on Behavior Intervention or the National Center on Intensive Intervention.
