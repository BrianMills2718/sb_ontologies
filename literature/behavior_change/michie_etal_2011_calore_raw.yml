A refined taxonomy of behaviour change techniques to help people change their physical activity and healthy eating behaviours: The CALO-RE taxonomy. Psychology and Health, 26(11), 1479-1498."

annotation: "The CALO-RE taxonomy is a refined 40-item classification system of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) for physical activity and healthy eating interventions, developed through systematic coding of intervention descriptions across multiple study centers. It provides standardized definitions to improve intervention reporting, replication, and evidence synthesis."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The CALO-RE taxonomy represents a structured theoretical framework with clear hierarchical relationships between behavior change techniques, their applications, and mechanisms of action. A property graph model best captures the interconnected nature of techniques, their theoretical foundations, implementation contexts, and relationships to behavioral outcomes."
