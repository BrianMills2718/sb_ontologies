Evidence-informed health intervention planning that incorporates theoretical and
empirical evidence and engages key stakeholders and community members or patients
in the planning process results in interventions that are more effective. Nevertheless,
exactly how and when to use evidence, theory, and community-based participation
during planning represents a challenge. In this Perspective, we describe Intervention
Mapping (IM), a framework for theory- and evidence-based health promotion program
planning that addresses this challenge by providing a systematic and stepwise approach
to planning interventions. IM has been used to develop health promotion interventions
and implementation strategies in community and clinical settings globally, with over 1000
published articles employing the framework. In this Perspective, we also highlight recent
and innovative applications of IM described in the articles of the Frontiers in Public Health
Special Topic on IM. We conclude by discussing new directions in the application of
IM including novel methods for identifying determinants of behavior and environmental
conditions, the application of IM for planning implementation strategies, and IM for
adaptation of evidence-based programs in new settings.

INTRODUCTION
The development of effective health promotion interventions often requires reviews of the relevant
literature, application of theories, collection of new data, and involvement of experts, community
members, and stakeholders in the planning process. Applying information from these varied
sources to inform intervention development presents a challenge for even well-trained health
promotion practitioners. The purpose of this perspective paper is to provide an overview of
Intervention Mapping, a framework for theory- and evidence-based health promotion program
planning, and to highlight examples of applications of IM, as described in the articles of the
Frontiers in Public Health Special Topic on Intervention Mapping publication (1).
IM is a planning framework that provides a systematic process and detailed protocol
for effective, step-by-step decision-making for intervention development, implementation, and
evaluation. It is grounded in community based participatory research methods to ensure that
the intervention matches priority population needs and intervention contexts. IM takes an
Fernandez et al. Health Promotion Planning: Intervention Mapping
ecological approach to understand health problems and to
intervene at multiple levels (e.g., individual, interpersonal,
organization, and community) and as such guides the
development of multi-level interventions.
IM provides guidelines and tools to ensure health promotion
program is based on empirical evidence and sound theories. IM
is also used for the planning and development of implementation
strategies for program adoption, implementation, and
maintenance (2). Following the IM process results in guidance
and documentation of decisions at each step, charting a
map from the initial steps of recognizing a need or problem
through evaluation and dissemination. Compared to other
protocols in health promotion planning, such as PRECEDE-
PROCEED (3), Behavior Centered Design (4), and COMBI
(5), IM helps planners to apply theories by linking social-
cognitive determinants of behavior to methods for behavior
and environmental change and by linking methods for
behavior change to practical applications that operationalize
these methods.
INTERVENTION MAPPING STEPS
The IM intervention development process has six steps: (1)
Establish a detailed understanding of the health problem, the
population at risk, the behavioral and environmental causes,
and the determinants of these behavioral and environmental
conditions; and, assess available resources; (2) Describe the
behavioral and environmental outcomes, create objectives for
changes in the determinants of behavior and environmental
causes, and specify the targets of the intervention program; (3)
Identify theory- and evidence-based behavior change methods
that influence the determinants and translate these to practical
applications that fit the intervention context; (4) Combine
the intervention components into a coherent program that
uses delivery channels that fit the context; (5) Develop
implementation strategies to facilitate adoption, implementation,
and maintenance of the program; and (6) Plan both process
and outcome evaluation to assess program implementation, and
efficacy or effectiveness (2).
IM thus defines and describes an iterative path from problem
identification to problem solving or mitigation (2). Each of the
six steps comprises several tasks, and completion of these tasks
creates a foundation for the next step. Completion of all six steps
results in a blueprint for designing, implementing, and evaluating
the intervention.
An IM approach is characterized by three perspectives, applied
during the program planning process: participatory planning,
eclectic use of theory, and an ecological and systems approach for
understanding health problems and intervening to address them
(3). Participatory perspectives emphasize equity in decision-
making and community and stakeholder engagement in all
phases of planning (6, 7). From this perspective, all aspects
of decision-making should involve the priority population and
program implementers to ensure that the program adequately
addresses community needs (6, 7). IM provides guidance at each
step for how to do this. Additionally, IM guides the use of theories
to understand the behavioral and environmental causes of health
problems, identify their determinants, and select change methods
to address them. Theories are abstractions of reality and may
provide only partial explanations for understanding the causes
of health problems (8, 9). In program planning, it is unlikely
that one theory can sufficiently explain influences on health and
provide guidance to address the causes. Thus, multiple theories
are often used. IM provides a framework for incorporating
multiple theories during intervention planning (10). Finally, an
ecological and systems perspective recognizes that social and
physical environmental conditions may have an even stronger
impact on behaviors than do factors related to individuals (11).
Below, we describe IM steps and tasks and highlight key
papers on IM that provide examples of how IM has been applied.
Finally, we present new directions and applications for IM in the
field of health promotion and beyond.
Figure 1 shows the six steps of the IM process and their related
tasks, while Figure 2 shows the environmental conditions that
influence individual behavior.
Step 1. Logic Model of the Problem
Step 1, which is based on the PRECEDE model (3), is a careful
description of the problem that will enable intervention planning.
The program-planning group conducts an analysis of health
and quality of life, behaviors, and environmental conditions that
contribute to the health problem directly or to the risk behaviors.
The group also identifies factors (determinants) that influence
the risk behaviors and problematic environmental conditions
contributing to the health problem. This step helps planners
distinguish between behaviors, environmental conditions, and
their determinants, helping them better articulate and document
needed changes and desired outcomes in Step 2.
Step 2. Logic Model of Change
In Step 2, the planning group articulates the desired health
promoting behaviors and environmental conditions. The group
then specifies performance objectives (or sub-behaviors) for the
at-risk group and for those responsible for making changes in the
environment. The planning group sets performance objectives
breaking down each behavior and environmental condition into
subcomponents by answering certain questions: “What does the
person need to do to accomplish the behavior?” and “What does
the environmental agent need to do to create the environmental
change?” They then identify determinants of health-promoting
behaviors and environmental conditions by asking: “Why would
someone do this behavior?” and “Why would someone make this
environmental change?”
To make decisions about salient determinants that should be
targeted with the intervention, IM guides planners through four
core processes (2): (1) involving representatives from the target
population, stakeholders, and implementers in brainstorming in
the planning group; (2) searching through empirical literature
for determinants of behavior or environmental conditions; (3)
identifying and applying pertinent theories on determinants that
influence these; and (4) conducting qualitative and quantitative
research to explore unanswered questions. Using the information
generated, the planning group sets priorities and selects a final list

FIGURE 1 | Intervention mapping steps and tasks [Bartholomew-Eldredge et al. (2), chapter 1].
of determinants to target (2, 12). The group then creates a matrix
of change objectives through combining performance objectives
and determinants. These same core processes are use in each step
of the IM process.
IM provides guidance on how to use theory to inform the
development process. Planning groups can identify appropriate
theories by (1) searching the literature on the health topic, (2)
matching ideas from the brainstorming process to theoretical
constructs, and (3) applying frequently used theories (9). The
theories can guide the identification of determinants and,
subsequently, the selection of methods (in Step 3) to influence
these determinants. For example, while answering, “Why would
someone engage in this behavior?” the planning group might
brainstorm, “The person has confidence that he or she could do
it,” which points to the theoretical construct of “self-efficacy” in
social cognitive theory (13). This labeling of answers to the “why”
question, using theory-based psychosocial constructs, leads to
the selection of appropriate change methods (e.g., modeling) in
Step 3.
Step 3. Program Design
In Step 3, the planning group discusses initial ideas for the
program and selects theory- and evidence-based behavior change
methods based on the determinants that they need to change
(2). A number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
health promotion programs show that reasonable use of theory-
based methods increases intervention effectiveness in changing
behavior (14–19). In this step, program objectives are arranged
or grouped by determinants. Theoretical methods that may
help achieve the program objectives are identified, and then
translated into practical applications or strategies. A theory-
based change method is a technique for changing a behavioral
determinant of an individual or environmental agent, while a
practical application is a specific strategy that delivers the method

FIGURE 2 | Multilevel factors influencing health.
in a way that fits the needs of the priority group and the program
setting. Some methods can be used for several determinants,
while others work only for a specific determinant (2).
There has been growing interest in systematic descriptions of
health promotion interventions, their theoretical methods,
and the determinants these methods are expected to
change. Abraham and Michie (20), for example, created the
Behavior Change Technique (BCT) taxonomy, used to identify
intervention content (21, 22). Peters et al. (18) nevertheless, note
that BCT taxonomies fail to describe the specific conditions
or requirements that make these methods effective (23). IM,
however, describes the parameters of methods that are essential
for both identifying successful methods in the literature and
for developing intervention components (21). For instance,
modeling is effective only if reinforced and when observers pay
attention, have adequate self-efficacy and skills, identify with
the model, and observe a coping model instead of a mastery
model (13). Each theoretical method has its own conditions
for effectiveness; for example, goal setting is effective only
when the selected goal is challenging but attainable (24). Fear
arousal requires high self-efficacy expectations about behavior
(18), which can be difficult due of the complex nature of most
behavior change settings. Khan et al. (25) described processes
(and their measures) that can be used by communities and local
governments in planning and monitoring environmental and
policy-level interventions for obesity prevention. Mesters et al.
(26) notes, however, that it is often difficult to determine which
components of the programs contribute to the effectiveness of
the health promotion program. Moreover, inadequate reporting
of theory and evidence-informed behavior change methods and
their applications further limits the ability to advance the science
of what works and makes program adaptation challenging. IM
responds to the call for better understanding and reporting of
intervention (27, 28).
Step 4. Program Production
In Step 4, the various applications selected in Step 3 are
organized and produced (2). The program planning group
decides the overall structure, themes, channels, and vehicles
of the program. They design and produce materials that are
culturally relevant and appealing, work with other stakeholders,
and pilot-test the pertinent program elements. The program
planning group is responsible for correctly translating theoretical
methods into practical applications, using the methods’
parameters. To this end, the program planning group and
production professionals (writers, video producers, graphic
artists) must work together to ensure that the final program
products are appealing and accessible as well as reflect the
key methods, practical applications, and messages developed
during the planning process. Step 4 includes pretesting and
ensures the implementation of effective program materials
and program fit with the particular context and population.
Typically, during pretesting, comprehension, attractiveness,
acceptance, believability, motivation, and preliminary
indications of effectiveness are assessed, and recommendations
for improvement are provided. Pretesting should be conducted
after concept and message design and materials development
but before materials are finalized (29, 30). It can be executed
using experimental research designs (31), focus groups, in-depth
interviews, and intercept surveys, among other methods.
Step 5. Program Implementation Plan
Effective health education and promotion programs can lose
their impact if they are not used before desired health impacts
are achieved (32–34). IM provides a systematic process for the
development of implementation strategies either for initial use
of the program or for scale-up and spread of evidence-based
programs already developed and tested. The use of IM to develop
implementation strategies provides for the clear articulation
of the mechanisms contained in these strategies, a gap in
the implementation science literature (35–37). Step 5 guides
the development of implementation approaches, also known
as strategies or interventions. This step guides the planning
group through thinking about adoption, implementation, and
maintenance as well as who has to do what at each of
these stages and why. Understanding the factors that influence
implementation is critical for the selection of methods to address
these factors.
Program implementers are the people who are responsible
for the delivery of the program and can include organizational
leaders responsible for program adoption and maintenance
as well as those responsible for actual delivery of program
materials and activities to participants. For example, nurses will
present programs to patients, and teachers will deliver health
education programs to students. Others in the organization or
setting, even though they are not program implementers, may
be responsible for making decisions about whether or not the
program is adopted and for identifying individuals who will
deliver the program. For example, school principals may not
deliver health education curriculum; however, their support for
program adoption and maintenance is critical.
IM Step 5 can be used not only to plan implementation the
first time a program is developed and used but also can be used
to develop plans for scale up and spread of existing evidence-
based interventions. Program planning groups can address
program implementers’ personal determinants, like knowledge
Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 4 August 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 209
Fernandez et al. Health Promotion Planning: Intervention Mapping
and outcome expectations for the program and self-efficacy for
enacting program activities at the individual level with methods,
such as persuasive communication, tailoring, and modeling.
However, implementation almost always involves organizational
change, which means program planning groups also have
to apply methods at environmental levels. Organizational
theory and implementation science frameworks can be used
to understand the determinants and contextual factors that
influence implementation and to guide the selection of methods
that will support program implementation (38, 39).
Step 6. Evaluation Plan
Effect and process evaluation will verify if the objectives
chosen in Steps 2 and 5, respectively, have been reached,
and need to be carefully planned. Previous IM steps help
inform the evaluation plan since behaviors, environments,
their sub-components, and determinants are clearly spelled
out (2). Fernandez et al. (57) describe the use of Intervention
Mapping for planning implementation strategies, a process we
call Implementation Mapping.
INTERVENTION MAPPING IN THE REAL
WORLD
Special-topic authors provide examples of the application of IM
across settings and topics (1). There are several examples of the
use of IM for the development of eHealth interventions. Shegog
and Begley (40), using IM, involved both a diverse planning
group and a patient provider advisory group to develop a decision
support tool (DST) to increase self-management among epilepsy
patients and their care providers. The tool is used to increase
awareness and efficacy of self-management behaviors among
epilepsy patients and their healthcare providers and to improve
communication during clinic visits. The Shegog and Begley
(40) paper includes a table that illustrates the identification
of methods, organized by determinants, and how these were
operationalized, using practical applications of the DST. The
authors demonstrate how the online decision-support system in
this case can include multiple methods and practical applications
to address users’ determinants of self-management.
Pot et al. (41) present the application of IM in the development
of a web-based, tailored intervention that promotes HPV
vaccination acceptance. In their study, mothers were the target
group and were systematically involved in the development
process. The mothers were ambivalent about HPV vaccination,
and the intervention focuses on informed decision-making.
The needs, behavioral outcomes, and targeted determinants are
carefully described and include examples, and the full matrices of
change objectives are found in the supplementary materials. The
web intervention combined freedom of choice with tunneling
and virtual assistants who delivered the tailored feedback. The
intervention was pilot-tested, and the implementation plan
focuses on the web-based intervention owners.
Rodriguez et al. (42) and Serra et al. (43) describe
the application of IM in planning interactive multimedia
applications for low-income Hispanics (Mexican Americans and
Puerto Ricans). Rodriguez et al. used IM in the development
of an intervention for parents to increase HPV vaccination in
adolescent girls. The authors also used IM steps to adapt the
intervention and create a module for parents of boys. The authors
select and operationalize methods targeting parents’ decision-
making, with implicit recognition of parameters. They also
describe using IM Step 5 for the development of implementation
strategies (delivery by lay health workers).
Serra et al. (43) applied IM to plan an intervention to
increase colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) in Puerto Rico. The
authors developed a needs and asset assessment that included
a review of factors that influence CRCS among Hispanics,
taking into account the preferences of the target group, and
collected data. They describe objectives at the level of behavior
(performance objectives) and determinants (change objectives).
They identified two overarching methods: entertainment
education and behavioral journalism. The intervention materials
included an interactive tablet-based application, print materials,
an action plan, with a follow-up phone call to determine and
address remaining barriers. As in the Shegog and Begley (40)
and Rodriguez et al. (42) examples, IM helped to identify
determinants, and the interactive tailoring features of the
intervention provided specific messages for users that depended
on their beliefs, knowledge, and identified barriers. Targeting
health care providers directly was not possible, but a patient
activation element (patient-mediated prompts) was added to the
intervention to increase provider recommendations and referrals
for CRCS.
Fassier et al. (44) describe the use of IM in the development
of an intervention to help breast cancer survivors in France
successfully return to work after treatment. The authors
emphasize the importance of taking an ecological perspective to
planning and note that IM can help identify and document
interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal
influences. They also describe the development of the planning
group, which included a broad array of stakeholders who
helped to identify priorities, and environmental conditions that
influenced the return to work. The paper provides an example
of the use of IM in the early stages of program development to
understand a problem at multiple levels, develop a logic model
of change, and guide assessment.
ten Hoor et al. (45) used IM to develop an intervention
to prevent obesity among Dutch adolescents. Using the
socioecological approach that underlies the IM process, they
identified important contributors to physical activity in the
adolescent’s social context, as based in social determination
and social comparison theories. They also extended the theory
of expanded, extended, and enhanced opportunities (TEO) for
physical activity to include “enriched” opportunities, such as the
incorporation of weight training into the school-based physical
activity program. The paper is an example of how IM can assist
in incorporating elements of different theoretical perspectives to
inform program development.
Vissenberg et al. (46) used IM to develop a social network-
based intervention for diabetes self-management targeted to
Dutch, Surinamese, Moroccan, and Turkish families who live in
the Netherlands. The authors note that underlying the challenges
to self-management behavior among these populations are
cultural factors and socioeconomic status. In line with IM, they
Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 5 August 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 209
Fernandez et al. Health Promotion Planning: Intervention Mapping
recommend a greater engagement of the priority populations and
other stakeholders in the planning process. The article provides
an example of a logic model as derived from the IM process.
Mesters et al. (26) used IM to analyze an effective intervention
to promote breastfeeding of infants at risk for asthma. The
authors noted that the literature suggests certain demographic,
biological, and social determinants at three time periods:
prenatal, postnatal initiation, and postnatal continuation. IM was
used to describe performance and to develop change objectives.
Environmental factors included the mother’s partner. Mesters
et al. provide examples of how the process of writing performance
objectives forced program planners to describe in detail the
actions necessary to accomplish behaviors, which ultimately led
to important content and effective strategies that may have
otherwise been omitted, e.g., the inclusion of the mother’s
partner. An evaluation of the program showed that it resulted
in positive behavioral changes, which the authors attributed to
a careful analysis of the determinants and preparation for the
unexpected negative attitudes of others (26).
NEW DIRECTIONS
Although IM provides guidance to identify needs and develop
interventions, additional research and approaches are needed
to more accurately address the questions posed by each of
the steps including the identification of determinants and the
selection of methods. Crutzen et al. (12) describe an approach
for selecting determinants to target in interventions. They
suggest visualization of confidence intervals and correlations.
The authors clearly explain the importance of identifying
determinants. They also note that currently used approaches
for identifying determinants are insufficient. They propose
a confidence interval-based estimation of relevance (CIBER)
approach for selecting determinants to target in an intervention.
In CIBER, the data are visualized as diamond plots. They
presented an MDMA (ecstasy) study, in which four determinants
are discussed, as an example of the use of CIBER. The statistical
tool is available at no cost.
Additional research is needed to build the evidence base for
the effectiveness of certain methods to address determinants.
Peters et al. (18) highlight the limitations of existing taxonomies
of methods derived from the meta-analyses of interventions,
which include misapplied methods without consideration of
parameters, confounding factors such as co-occurring methods,
and the interaction of methods and context. In response, they
propose an “iterative protocol for evidence base accumulation,”
whereby researchers conduct meta-analyses of applied health
behavior change interventions, taking into consideration the
parameters of those methods. This research would then lead
to basic experimental studies that test methods under various
conditions. Meta-analyses of these experiments would then
provide information about which methods are effective and
under which conditions.
IM addresses the growing body of evidence on the influence
of the environmental context on health and health behavior
[e.g., (47)] by providing a robust framework for planning
health interventions that considers various facets of the
environment. Springer et al. (48) explore how health planners
and practitioners can further incorporate the environmental
context of health intervention design through the concept
of health promotion interweaving. Building from theoretical
perspectives rooted in social-ecological models, improvement
science, and systems thinking, this paper advances an
indigenous health intervention development approach that
takes into account the environmental context, to designing
interventions. While IM is specifically structured for the
community and stakeholder involvement, an important
contribution of this paper is its description of theory- and
practice-based interweaving concepts (49, 50) in relation to
specific environments, such as Health in All Policies (policy
environment), environmental print (information environment),
appropriable organization (social/organizational environment),
and shared use agreements (built environment). Springer and
colleagues’ exploration of health promotion interweaving as a
health planning approach promotes greater intentionality for
designing health promotion strategies, practices, programs, and
policies (47, 49, 50).
Using IM to plan implementation strategies has recently
gained attention (37, 51) partly due to the challenges of applying
implementation science theories and framework to inform the
planning process. Highfield et al. (52) describe the use of IM to
develop an implementation intervention to increase adoption,
implementation, and maintenance of an existing evidence-based
program to improve mammography adherence in community
healthcare clinics. The goal was to scale-up the Peace of Mind
Program, which had been previously adapted, using IM (53),
for African American Women served by community clinics. The
authors describe the steps in their process and provide examples
of how implementation science theories and frameworks can
inform the IM process.
Based on the recognition that evidence-based sexual health
education programs are underutilized by school districts, Peskin
et al. (54) used IM to create an online tool to help school districts
to adopt, implement, and maintain evidence-based sexual health
education programs. The authors had previously developed the
Choosing and Maintaining Effective Programs for Sex Education
in Schools (CHAMPS) model. They provide an example of the
use IM for planning implementation interventions. This paper
also provides an example of how IM can be useful in adapting
evidence-based interventions so that they can be delivered
through different platforms.
The use of IM as a tool in implementation science for the
development of implementation strategies is growing (55–57).
Using IM increases the ability to map strategies to specific
barriers and facilitators of implementation, with a particular
focus on the mechanisms and methods that will bring about the
needed changes. Thus, the application of IM in the development
of implementation strategies can address a knowledge and
practice gap in implementation science.
CONCLUSION
IM helps health promoters to develop well-thought-out theory-
and evidence-based programs through the identification of
Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 6 August 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 209

key changeable determinants of risk behaviors, the choice of
appropriate intervention methods and applications, and the
development of implementation strategies to ensure use and
dissemination. Although the IM process is described through
its sequential steps, IM is intended to be iterative, and, indeed,
most of the studies presented above describe the IM planning
process this way. Throughout the process, planners gain new
knowledge about the population, determinants, environment,
and/or effective and appropriate methods that sometimes
requires cycling through earlier steps to expand or refine
the program.
The IM protocol assists program-planning groups
to optimize the chances of program effectiveness, and
IM has been utilized widely across multiple health
domains, populations, and settings all over the world.
The use of IM can make health education and health
promotion programs stronger, more effective, and more
widely disseminated to improve the impact of public
health programs.
