The behavior change technique taxonomy (v1) of 93 hierarchically clustered techniques: building an international consensus for the reporting of behavior change interventions. Annals of Behavioral Medicine, 46(1), 81-95."

annotation: "Presents BCT Taxonomy v1, a hierarchically structured classification system of 93 consensually agreed behavior change techniques organized into 16 clusters, developed through Delphi methods and international expert consensus to standardize intervention reporting and enable systematic accumulation of evidence about active ingredients in behavior change interventions."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The BCT taxonomy represents a complex hierarchical network where individual techniques (nodes) are connected through categorical relationships, implementation dependencies, and functional similarities (edges). The 16 clusters form meta-categories that group techniques by similar mechanisms of action, while specific techniques can be combined and cross-referenced, creating a interconnected semantic network ideal for property graph representation."
