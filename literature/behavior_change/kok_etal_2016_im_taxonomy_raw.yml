annotation: "This paper presents the Intervention Mapping (IM) taxonomy of behavior change methods, emphasizing the distinction between theory-based methods and practical applications, the importance of parameters for effectiveness, and the need to target appropriate determinants that predict behavior. The taxonomy provides a comprehensive framework for both intervention development and coding purposes, addressing individual and environmental levels of behavior change."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The IM taxonomy represents a complex network of interconnected theoretical constructs including behavior change methods, determinants, beliefs, practical applications, and parameters for effectiveness. These elements form nodes with relationships (targeting, embodying, influencing, translating) that create a comprehensive theoretical network. The multi-level ecological approach (individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, societal) further supports a property graph structure with hierarchical and cross-level relationships."
