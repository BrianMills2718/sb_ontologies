annotation: "Comprehensive taxonomy for describing and characterizing intervention protocols that expands existing guidelines. Developed through analysis of 18 Health Maintenance Consortium studies and refined through pilot testing. Organizes intervention features into delivery characteristics and content strategies to improve intervention design, replication, and cross-study analysis."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "Property graph model is optimal for representing the ITAX framework because it captures the complex relationships between intervention components, delivery characteristics, content strategies, and mechanisms of action. The taxonomy involves multiple interconnected entities (interventions, participants, interventionists, strategies) and their relationships (delivery modes, adaptability rules, implementation measures). This structure allows for modeling both the hierarchical organization of intervention features and the dynamic interactions between different components during intervention delivery and assessment."
