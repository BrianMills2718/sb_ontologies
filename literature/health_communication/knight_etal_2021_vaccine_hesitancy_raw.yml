annotation: "A systematic approach to developing a digital intervention for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy using motivational interviewing principles. The study employed a four-stage development process: identifying common hesitancy reasons through surveys and literature review, gathering expert responses, creating therapeutic dialogues based on MI principles, and developing a web-based platform. The intervention addresses 10 core vaccine concerns within the WHO 3C framework (confidence, complacency, convenience)."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "A property graph model best represents this intervention development framework because it captures the complex relationships between hesitancy concerns, expert responses, motivational interviewing techniques, and intervention components. The theoretical structure involves multiple interconnected entities (concerns, responses, MI principles, dialogue elements) linked through various relationship types (addresses, utilizes, implements, targets). This creates a semantic network that models both the intervention development process and the underlying theoretical mechanisms."
