annotation: Young argues that importing the symbol-rich formalism of semantic networks
  into cognitive mapping—implemented in the WorldView system—greatly expands what
  scholars can extract about actors’ belief systems and decision processes. The paper
  reviews limits of matrix-based maps, introduces WorldView’s enhanced coding, aggregation,
  and measurement tools, and positions the approach for dynamic modeling of belief
  change.

model_type: property_graph
rationale: The core ideas revolve around concepts (nodes) connected by typed links
  (edges) with attributes and metrics; this structure is naturally captured by a property
  graph that can store entities, relationships, properties, actions, and measures.
