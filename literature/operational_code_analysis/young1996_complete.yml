model_type: "WorldView enhanced cognitive mapping using semantic\u2010network formalism"
rationale: "Young introduces WorldView to eliminate the limits of adjacency\u2013\
  matrix cognitive maps by\n(a) elevating relationships to nodes within a semantic\
  \ network,\n(b) differentiating relationship kinds, truth-values and modifiers,\n\
  (c) retaining conjunctions, actions and salience counts,\n(d) supplying a synonym\
  \ facility and aggregation routines, and\n(e) providing structural and comparative\
  \ measures (dependency, connectedness, size, uniformity of salience, concept comparison,\
  \ transformation cost, incongruence),\n(f) enabling dynamic reasoning through directed-walk\
  \ and spreading activation."

  definitions:
    node_types:
      Concept: Unique term appearing in the text; becomes a node.
      Relationship: A node that links concepts; carries truth-value, modifier, salience.
      Conjunction: Node representing 'and' or 'or' used with compound concepts.
    relationship_categories:
      '=': equal
      '>': condition component preference / greater-than
      +: positive-cause
      '-': negative-cause
      attribute: property (attribute) relationship
      is-a: class inclusion
      if-then: conditional relationship
      possess: ownership relationship
      strategy: "means\u2013ends relationship"
      know: knowledge relationship
      warrant-for: justification relationship
      location: spatial relationship
    truth_values:
    - 'true'
    - 'false'
    - partial
    - possible
    - impossible
    relationship_modifiers:
    - past
    - present
    - future
    - goal
    - hypothetical
    - normative
    conjunctions:
    - and
    - or
    salience:
      definition: Integer count of how often a unique relationship occurs in the data
        set.
      calculation: Count frequency of identical subject-relation-object triples across
        text
    structural_measures:
      dependency:
        symbol: D_G
        formula: "D_G = ( \u03A3 bridges_G / \u03A3 relationships_G ) / \u03A3 structures_G"
        interpretation: Vertical organization; proportion of bridges per structure.
        implementation: Count relationships that are the only path to a concept (bridges)
      connectedness:
        symbol: C_G
        formula: "C_G = \u03A3 relationships_G / ( \u03A3 concepts_G + \u03A3 relationships_G\
          \ )"
        interpretation: Degree to which concepts are interrelated.
        implementation: Calculate ratio of relationships to total elements
      size:
        definition: Count of concepts in the cognitive map.
        implementation: Count unique concept nodes
      uniformity_of_salience:
        definition: Standard deviation of relationship salience values within the
          map.
        implementation: Calculate std dev of all relationship salience scores
    comparative_measures:
      concept_comparison: Lists identical, altered and unique concepts across two
        maps.
      transformation_cost:
        definition: 'Minimum number of discrete changes (relationship-addition, relationship-deletion,

          salience increment/decrement, concept-deletion, concept-addition) needed
          to turn one map into another; each change has cost 1.'
        implementation: Levenshtein-style edit distance between cognitive maps
      incongruence:
        definition: 'Measure combining transformation cost and concept comparison,
          restricted to

          concepts common to both maps; zero only for identical structures.'
        implementation: Compare overlapping concepts between maps over time
    reasoning_methods:
      directed_walk:
        description: Spreading activation reasoning model using salience heuristic
        algorithm: '1. Start with input proposition

          2. Find proposition with highest salience to activate

          3. Process indicated operations

          4. Select most salient proposition from conclusion

          5. Repeat until no further progress (policy output or integration complete)'
        implementation: Search cognitive map using salience weights to guide activation
        example_output: "(soviet-union invade true present afghanistan)\n\u2192 (soviet-union\
          \ is-a true present sovereign-nation)\n\u2192 (united-states resist true\
          \ hypothetical (sovereign-nation invade true present sovereign-nation))"
      spreading_activation:
        description: Generate definition of situation through network traversal
        implementation: Activate related concepts based on semantic network connections

      synonym_facility:
        definition: User-defined mapping that collapses synonymous concepts during
          compilation.
        implementation: Create synonym dictionary and apply during concept aggregation
      aggregation:
        definition: Combines multiple texts or subject responses into a composite
          map.
        implementation: Merge concept nodes and sum relationship saliences across
          texts
      manipulable_map:
        definition: Semantic-network format that reasoning models can traverse.

          to algorithms
