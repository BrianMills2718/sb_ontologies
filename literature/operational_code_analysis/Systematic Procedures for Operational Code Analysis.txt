In this article we introduce a new scoring system for doing operational
code analysis and test its reliability and validity by measuring and model-
ing President Jimmy Carter's operational code. Using speeches from the
public record, we construct indices for the elements of the operational code
construct. Based upon the valences and scaled intensities of verbs uttered
in the speeches, President Jimmy Carter's views of the political universe
and approaches to political action in different issue areas are identified
and compared. The results of the analysis provide reasonable support for
the face, construct, and content validity of the operational code indices.
We find that Carter's view of the political universe and approach to
political action were consistent across issue areas during the first three
years of his term as president. Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
President Carter's support for human rights remained steadfast. Statisti-
cally significant shifts occurred in his views of the Soviet Union and others
in the political universe and in his approach to political action regarding
the conduct of U.S.-Soviet relations and other issues.
An important set of variables in the decision-making approach to foreign policy
analysis is the decision maker's worldview and predispositions toward political
action (Snyder, Bruck, and Sapin, 1962; Herrmann, 1988; Kaplowitz, 1990). A
variety of methods exist for evaluating these elements of a leader's definition of the

situation based upon previous behavior, public rhetoric, and archival and biographi-
cal sources. Operational code analysis is one of these methods and has a long history
(Leites, 1951, 1953; George, 1969, 1979; Holsti, 1970, 1977; Walker, 1977, 1983,
1993). It has languished in recent years because the qualitative content analysis
techniques used to retrieve and evaluate a leader's operational code have remained
relatively subjective and unsystematic.
However, these methodological problems do not undermine the relevance of a
focus on the leader's diagnosis of the political universe and choice propensities for
conflictual and cooperative actions in world politics. In this article we present
systematic procedures for the reproducible analysis of these features of the opera-
tional code construct, which we hope will generate a set of directly comparable
studies. Our goal is to illustrate how our indices address the following research
questions posed by George (1969, 1979) and Holsti (1977) about the elements of a
leader's operational code.
What are the leader's philosophical propensities for diagnosing:
P-1. the fundamental nature of politics, political conflict, and the image of the
opponent;
P-2. the general prospects for realizing one's fundamental political values;
P-3. the extent to which the political future is predictable;
P-4. the extent to which political leaders can influence historical developments
and control outcomes;
P-5. the role of chance?
What are the leader's instrumental propensities for choosing:
I-1. the best approach for selecting goals for political action, i.e., strategy;
1-2. how such goals and objectives can be pursued most effectively, i.e., tactics;
1-3. the best approach to calculation, control, and acceptance of the risks of
political action;
1-4. the "timing" of action;
1-5. the utility and role of different means?
George (1969, 1979), Holsti (1970, 1977), and others used these questions to
identify a leader's operational code as constituting a "belief system." Their concep-
tualization of belief system was the one defined by Converse (1964:207-8) as "a
configuration of ideas and attitudes in which the elements are bound together by
some form of constraint or functional interdependence." This conceptualization
generated hypotheses that operational code beliefs were internally coherent, re-
mained stable over time, and extended across issue domains for a particular leader.
Subsequent empirical research supported these hypotheses for some, but not all,
leaders (Walker, 1977; Anderson, 1977; Holsti, 1977; Stuart, 1979; Walker and
Falkowski, 1984a, 1984b).
A theoretical stance more consistent with these mixed results and with the
revolution in cognitive psychology is to conceptualize a leader's operational code as
a set of alternative "states of mind." This position allows for the possibility of (1)
incoherence among beliefs within as well as across individuals, (2) compartmentali-
zation of beliefs within the same individual into schemata that vary by issue or actor
domains, (3) learning (defined as change in beliefs) over time by a leader, and (4)
an idealized, "default" state of mind that defines the self-identity of the decision
maker in the absence of environmental stimuli that arouse another set of schemata
(Larson, 1985; Herrmann, 1988; Levy, 1994; Walker, 1995).
Within this more flexible theoretical context, we are not directly interested in the
specific content of the particular attitudes or beliefs that make up an individual's
operational code. We focus instead upon creating indices to evaluate the five

philosophical and five instrumental propensities identified by George (1969, 1979).
We evaluate these propensities by first identifying attribution properties for the
beliefs that a leader expresses, conceptualized most generally as positive or negative
valences for self-other relationships. Then we characterize these self-other valences
more specifically as different forms of either cooperative or conflictual behavior that
represent the exercise of political power between the self and others. The systematic
observation of these relationships allows us to construct indices for each of the ten
operational code questions.
The following operational code indices use raw data generated by the Verbs in
Context System (VICS), a content analysis system for retrieving and identifying
attributions in speeches. The assumptions behind each index vary somewhat, but
there are four features that inform the scoring system as a whole and provide its
substantive, methodological, and theoretical justification.
First, the substantive focus of operational code analysis is on diagnosing the use
of power by others in the political universe and on the leader's own propensities for
exercising political power. Power refers here to the interplay of different kinds of
control relationships between the self and others in the political universe, including
the positive sanctions of authority, influence, and reward versus the negative
sanctions of resistance, threat, and punishment (see Dahl, 1957; French and Raven,
1959; McClelland, 1968, 1969; Baldwin, 1971a, 1971b, 1978, 1979, 1980; Lukes,
1986). Second, the methodological focus of operational code analysis is on the verbs
in the leader's rhetoric, which indicate the balance, central tendency, and dispersion
of these forms of power attributed to the self and others as descriptions of self-other
relationships. Third, the focus upon positive and negative sanctions is consistent
with a renewed interest in "hot," that is, affect-laden, cognition by cognitive
psychologists; the (+) valences for the verbs indicate the direction of affect associ-
ated with the forms of power (Zajonc, 1980; Tomkins, 1981; Fiske and Taylor, 1991).
Fourth, the theoretical scope of operational code analysis is to explain the state's
management of conflict with other states through the steering effects of the leader's
propensities regarding the exercise of power at different levels of decision (Leites,
1951, 1953; George, 1969, 1979; Walker, 1990).
This combination of features makes the operational code construct a personal-
ity-in-situation approach to decision making in the political domain (Smith, 1968;
Greenstein, 1987). We believe that an explicit focus upon the interactive exercise of
power by the self and others distinguishes it from other approaches developed by
cognitive psychologists and personality theorists. These features orient the analysis
explicitly toward the decisions rather than the perceptions of leaders as a dependent
variable and conceptualizes these decisions within a process of tactical and strategic
interactions.
While we do not follow the classic operational code studies by George (1969) and
Holsti (1970, 1977) and postulate a hierarchical and internally coherent belief
system as the leader's operational code, our indices of a leader's operational code
are related in a hierarchical order. The indices for I-1 and P-1 summarize the
balance between the leader's attribution of cooperative and conflictual properties
to self and others. The indices for the remaining instrumental (self) and philosophi-
cal (other) elements are disaggregations of these two indices into different measures
of central tendency, balance, and dispersion.
The instrumental indices correspond to different properties of decision: direc-
tion (I-1), intensity (1-2), variety (1-3), sequence (1-4), and type (1-5). The parallel
properties between the code's instrumental elements and foreign policy decisions
provides a comparative advantage to the operational code construct for the analysis
of foreign policy decisions at the strategic, tactical, and behavioral levels of decision
(Snyder and Diesing, 1977; Walker, 1982; Leng and Walker, 1982; Leng, 1993).

178 Operational Code Analysis
event categories (McClelland and Hoggard, 1969) creates opportunities to establish
some isomorphic relations between the two constructs, a possibility we intend to
explore in future research. Here we are content to introduce and illustrate our
method of profiling a leader's operational code and test its validity as a necessary
first step toward this future goal.
Operational Code Indices
The core of operational code analysis has three dimensions with a common focus
upon the power relationships between self and others. They are what we call
(1) diagnostic propensities, (2) choice propensities, and (3) shift propensities in the
management of conflict and bargaining with others, which the leader exhibits
through positive and negative attributions to the self and others (see George, 1969,
1979, 1980; Walker, 1990, 1993). We infer answers to the operational code questions
dealing with these different propensities, using the following reasoning to link our
indices with the concepts in the operational code construct.
Diagnostic Propensities
The leader's net attribution of positive/cooperative (+) versus negative/conflictual
(-) valences to others indicates the answers to the first philosophical question dealing
with the nature of politics (P-1). The key assumption here is that beliefs about how
others approach and pursue their goals in the political universe define the nature
of politics, political conflict, and the image of the opponent for the leader. That is,
the more cooperative the leader's diagnosis of the nature of the political universe,
the higher the net frequency of cooperative attributions to others in the political
universe.
P-1. NATURE OF POLITICAL UNIVERSE. Index: % Positive Other Attribu-
tions minus % Negative Other Attributions. Comments: -1.0 = Conflic-
tual.... + 1.0 Cooperative.
The index for P-I is generally consistent with the logic in Holsti's (1977) typology
of operational codes, which differentiates leaders in terms of friendly versus hostile
views of the political universe (see Walker, 1983).
Holsti also distinguishes optimistic from pessimistic leaders regarding the pros-
pects for achieving one's fundamental political values (P-2) on the basis of their belief that
conflict is either temporary or permanent in the political universe. We assume that
the more optimistic the leader's diagnosis for realizing one's political values, the
less negative and more positive the net intensity of attributions to others in the
political universe.
P-2. REALIZATION OF POLITICAL VALUES. Index: Mean Intensity of Other
Conflict/Cooperation Transitive Verb Attributions for Scale with Values of
-3 = Punish, -2 = Threaten, -1 = Oppose/Resist, 0 = Neutral, +1 =
Appeal/Support, +2 = Promise, +3 = Reward. Comments: To make the
scale's range more comparable to the other indices, the mean is divided by
3 to obtain a range of - 1.0 Pessimistic.... + 1.0 Optimistic. In calculating the
mean index, we omit the cases in the zero category.
The index for P-2 scales cooperative (friendly) and conflictual (hostile) acts into six
categories inspired by the social power literature (e.g., Dahl, 1957; French and
Raven, 1959; McClelland, 1968, 1969; McClelland and Hoggard, 1969; Baldwin,
1971a, 1971b, 1978, 1979, 1980; see also Cartwright, 1959; Lukes, 1986). We
associate optimism with a positive mean intensity score and pessimism with a
negative mean intensity score.

The leader's tendency to assign different types of conflict and cooperative
actions to others indicates one answer to the third philosophical question, which
deals with the predictability of the politicalfuture (P-3). This inference is based upon
the premises of information theory, where uncertainty corresponds to total
variety within a set of categories and certainty corresponds to total uniformity
within a set of categories (McClelland, 1968, 1972; see also Garner, 1962).
Therefore, the more unpredictable the political actions of others, the greater
the variation in other-attributions among different types of cooperative or
conflictual acts. And if one believes that all acts by others fall into the same
category, then predictability is highest.
P-3. POLITICAL FUTURE. Index: [1 minus IQV], where IQV equals the Index
of Qualitative Variation. "The Index of Qualitative Variation is a ratio of
the number of different pairs of observations in a distribution to the
maximum possible number of different pairs for a distribution with the
same N [number of cases] and the same number of variable classifications"
(Watson and McGaw, 1980:88). Comments: .00 Lowest....1.0 Highest Pre-
dictability.
The balance between the leader's self-attributions and other-attributions indi-
cates the answers to the fourth philosophical question dealing with the extent to which
the leader can control historical developments and political outcomes (P-4). This reasoning
is based upon inferences from the locus-of-control research dealing with the
perception of power in social relationships (Lefcourt, 1976; Phares, 1976;
Kaplowitz, 1978; Langer, 1983). If the leader attributes more words and deeds to
others, for example, then the locus of control is in others rather than in the self.
The greater the leader's control over political outcomes compared to the control by
others, the higher the net attributions assigned to the self.
P-4. CONTROL OVER HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT. Index: Self Attribu-
tions divided by [Self Attributions plus Other Attributions]. Comments: .00
Other Locus of Control....+ 1.0 Self Locus of Control.
The answer to the fifth philosophical question regarding the role of chance (P-5)
in forecasting the future and predicting political outcomes is logically a function
of the answers to the third and fourth philosophical questions. That is, the higher
the role of chance, the greater the variation in the distribution of acts by others
and the lower the leader's net self-attributions. This conclusion is based upon
the reasoning that if both the predictability of others and the leader's control
over political outcomes are relatively low, then the role of chance is relatively
high.
P-5. ROLE OF CHANCE. Index: 1 minus [Predictability Index multiplied by
the Control Over Historical Development Index]. Comments: .00 Low-
est....1.0 Highest Role of Chance.
Choice Propensities
The leader's net attribution of positive (cooperative) and negative (conflictual)
valences to the self indicates the answer to the first instrumental question. It
represents a leader's strategic approach to political goals (I-1) and assumes that the
more cooperative the leader's strategic approach to political goals, the higher the
net frequency of cooperative attributions to the self. This reasoning does not specify
how the leader selects goals or what goals s/he selects. However, it does identify the
strategic direction the leader adopts in approaching them (Snyder and Diesing,
1977; Leng, 1993).

180 Operational Code Analysis
I-1. STRATEGY. Index = % Positive Self Attributions minus % Negative Self
Attributions. Comments: -1.0 Conflictual Strategy....+1.0 Cooperative
Strategy.
Intensity in pursuing a conflictual or cooperative strategy indicates the answer to
the second instrumental question. This attribute represents the tactics for how goals
and objectives can be pursued most effectively (1-2). Whereas strategy refers to the
direction of a leader's approach to political goals, tactics refers first of all to the
intensity with which the leader pursues the strategy (Snyder and Diesing, 1977;
Leng, 1993). We assume, therefore, that the more cooperative the leader's tactics
in the pursuit of goals and objectives, the greater the net intensity of cooperative
self-attributions.
1-2. TACTICS. Index: Mean Intensity of Self Conflict/Cooperation Attributions
for Scale with Values of-3 = Punish, -2 = Threaten, -1 = Oppose/Resist,
0 = Neutral, + 1 = Appeal/Support, +2 = Promise, +3 = Reward. Com-
ments: To make the scale's range more comparable to the other indices,
the mean is divided by 3 to obtain a range of -1.0 Very Conflictual
Tactics.... + 1.0 Very Cooperative Tactics. In calculating the mean index, we
omit the cases in the zero category.
The distribution of self-attributions into different categories of cooperative and
conflictual acts indicates the answer to the fifth instrumental question regarding the
utility and role of different means (1-5) in the exercise of power. We conceptualize the
exercise of political power as the choice of a control relationship between self and
other in which self seeks or maintains control of relationships with others by using
different types of words and deeds as positive or negative sanctions. Operationally,
they represent attempts by self to get others to say or do something they would not
otherwise say or do.
1-5. UTILITY OF MEANS. Index: Percentages for Transitive Verb Categories
(Punish, Threaten, Oppose/Resist, Appeal/Support, Promise, Reward).
Comments: .00 Low Utility.... 1.0 High Utility for each category of means.
The Appeal/Support and the Oppose/Resist categories represent positive and
negative appeals by self to other's moral values as the means of control. The Promise
and Reward categories classify the verbal and physical use of positive sanctions while
the Threaten and Punish categories refer to their counterparts in the exercise of
negative sanctions as the means of control.
Shift Propensities
In addition to choice propensities, tactics involve answers to the questions below
dealing with risk and timing, or what we call shift propensities. The diversity in the
types of acts attributed to the self across several categories indicates the answer to
the third instrumental question regarding the leader's approach to calculation, control,
and acceptance of the risks of political action (1-3). The risks, that is, undesirable
outcomes, associated with cooperative and conflictual actions are the risk of submis-
sion associated with a cooperative act in the pursuit of a settlement and the risk of
deadlock associated with a conflictual act in the pursuit of domination. This
reasoning is based upon the concepts of risk acceptance and risk aversion toward
different political outcomes (e.g., see Milburn and Billings, 1976; Snyder and
Diesing, 1977; Morrow, 1987).
1-3. RISK ORIENTATION. Index: [1 minus IQV] for self-attributions. See the
index for P-3 for a definition of IQV. Comments: .00 Risk Averse (Low
Predictability).... 1.0 Risk Acceptant (High Predictability).

STEPHEN G. WALKER ET AL. 181
A relatively unpredictable distribution across conflict and cooperation categories
indicates a relatively averse position regarding the risks of both submission and
deadlock. If a leader's self-attributions are more predictable and mainly in coop-
erative categories, then the leader is relatively acceptant regarding the risk of
submission to an opponent. On the other hand, if the distribution is skewed toward
conflict categories, then the leader is relatively acceptant of the risk of deadlock.
The distinction between conflict versus cooperation indicates answers to the
fourth instrumental question regarding the leader's position on the matter of the timing
of action (1-4). We assume that the more important the timing of action in assessing
the risks of political acts, the greater the propensity to shift between conflict and
cooperation. If the leader's shift propensity between conflictual and cooperative acts
is low, then the strategic approach to goals is more likely to be the dominant strategy
no matter what others in the political universe say or do.
I-4a. TIMING OF COOPERATION V. CONFLICT. Index: Shift Propensity is
1 minus Absolute Value of [% Positive Self-Attributions minus % Negative
Self-Attributions]. Comments: .00 Low Shift Propensity.... 1.0 High Shift
Propensity.
The propensity to shift between words and deeds represents another aspect of
timing in the way a leader calculates, controls, and accepts the risks of political
action. Leaders who show a low propensity to shift between words and deeds are
relatively acceptant regarding the risks associated with the direction of the distribu-
tion. A higher shift propensity indicates a more risk-averse orientation toward the
undesirable outcomes of submission or deadlock.
I-4b. TIMING OF WORDS V. DEEDS. Index: Shift Propensity is 1 minus
Absolute Value of [% Words minus % Deeds]. Comments: .00 Low Shift
Propensity.... 1.0 High Shift Propensity.
Finally, we have created a summary index for the elements of the operational
code construct, which measures the degree of difference between self and other.
The signs for each half of the index indicate the overall nature of the self-other
relationship (+,+; -, +; +,-; -,-). The sign of the result indicates the direction of
the relationship between self and other: a negative sign indicates self is less
cooperative/more conflictual than other; a positive sign indicates self is more
cooperative/less conflictual than other. The magnitude of the result indicates the
difference between self and other.
SUMMARY. Index: [(% Positive Self-Attributions minus % Negative Self-
Attributions) minus (% Positive Other-Attributions minus % Negative
Other-Attributions)] divided by two. Comments: Varies between -1.0 and
+ 1.0.
We evaluate these indices below in an assessment of President Jimmy Carter's
operational code. A focus upon President Carter provides us with an opportunity
to test the face, construct, and content validity of our operational code indices
(Carmines and Zeller, 1979). He was regarded as the first postwar president to
transcend a Cold War mentality in the wake of the Vietnam war. He and his advisors
entered the chief executive's office with an image of the international system that
was characterized by complex interdependence (Hoffmann, 1978; Rosati, 1987; see
also Brzezinski, 1970, 1983; Keohane and Nye, 1977).
We can assess the face validity of our indices by comparing the fit between this
popular view of President Carter and his general operational code. President Carter
also reported a dramatic learning experience in dealing with the USSR following
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and Iran's seizure of American hostages (Sick,

1986). These discrete events allow us to pursue a quasi-experimental research
design to test for construct validity by hypothesizing the direction and degree of
change in his operational code following these events (Campbell and Stanley, 1963).
Finally, we can explore the content validity of Jimmy Carter's operational code
by disaggregating the construct validity analysis across issue areas to see if the
operational code indices are sensitive to changes in issue area over time. The results
should provide some insights into the coherence among elements of President
Carter's operational code and indicate their temporal stability and generalizability
to different issue areas.
Continuity and Change in Jimmy Carter's Operational Code
We begin our analysis by retrieving and coding a collection of twenty-two speeches
by Carter from available public sources. The data set was originally gathered to
compare an analysis of Carter's cognitive map with an earlier belief system analysis
of Carter based upon sixteen of the same twenty-two speeches (Young, 1994; see
also Rosati, 1987). The additional six speeches of similar length, topic, and audience
were selected to offset the uneven temporal distribution of the original sixteen
speeches. Even the additional six speeches do not provide an even distribution
across the four years of the Carter presidency because he simply did not make many
speeches of this type in the latter half of 1979 and 1980 (Young, 1994).
The following attribution analysis of Carter's operational code represents a
valence-oriented, intermediate analysis between the earlier structure-oriented
(Young, 1996) cognitive map and content-oriented (Rosati, 1987) belief system
analyses. The rhetoric from these speeches is coded into self- and other-attributions
for those statements that contain foreign policy content. The criteria for foreign
policy content include the following: (1) the subject and object are international in
scope; (2) the focus of interaction is a political issue; (3) the words and deeds are
cooperative or contlictual. The self- and other-attributions are identified and coded
as either positive (+) or negative (-) and then into categories from the Verbs in
Context System (VICS) in Figure 1.
The transitive verb classifications in VICS aggregate cooperative and conflictual
words and deeds. The dictionary of conflict and cooperation categories includes,
but is not limited to, the words and deeds in the World Event Interaction Survey
(WEIS) data coding scheme (McClelland and Hoggard, 1969). These categories and
their synonyms in WorldView, a computer-based tool for mapping semantic net-
works in texts, are the basis for retrieving and identifying the transitive verbs in
utterances from President Carter's speeches dealing with foreign policy issues
(Young, 1994, 1996). Intercoder reliability results for two coders with twelve hours
of training are percentage agreement scores (Krippendorf, 1980) of .72 and .83
with the coding decisions of WorldView's author for randomly selected passages
from Carter's speeches.
We code these attributions into the VICS categories in Figure 1 and then
disaggregate them into two of the issue areas that helped define the Carter
administration's foreign policy record, namely, "U.S.-Soviet Relations" and "Hu-
man Rights," leaving the remaining foreign policy attributions in an "Other Issues"
category. We compare Carter's self- and other-attributions within and across these
issue areas over time.
Face Validity
President Carter brought a complex image of the international system to the White
House without the mentality of a cold warrior (Rosati, 1987, 1993). His evangelical
religiosity supplemented and reenforced this vision of the political universe with a

STEPS IN THE VERBS IN CONTEXT SYSTEM
1. IDENTIFY THE SUBJECT AS
SELF OR OTHER
2. IDENTIFY THE TENSE OF THE TRANSITIVE VERB AS
PAST PRESENT FUTURE
AND IDENTIFY THE CATEGORY OF THE VERB AS
POSITIVE (+) OR NEGATIVE (-)
APPEAL, SUPPORT (+ 1) OPPOSE, RESIST (-1)
WORDS OR ORPROMISE BENEFITS (+2) THREATEN COSTS (-2)
DEEDS REWARDS (+3) PUNISHMENTS (-3)
3. IDENTIFY THE DOMAIN AS
DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN
4. IDENTIFY TARGET AND PLACE IN CONTEXT
An Example
A quote taken from President Carter's January 4, 1980, address to the nation:
"Massive Soviet military forces have invaded the small, non-aligned, sovereign
nation of Afghanistan . . "
1. Subject. The subject is "Massive Soviet military forces" which is coded as
other, that is, the speaker is not referring to his or her self or his or her state.
2. Tense and Category. The verb phrase "have invaded" is in the past tense
and is a negative deed coded, therefore, as punish.
3. Domain. The action involves an actor (Soviet military forces) external to the
speaker's state (the United States); therefore, the domain is foreign.
4. Target and Context. The action is directed toward Afghanistan; therefore,
the target is coded as Afghanistan. In addition, we designate a context: Soviet-

propensity to select cooperative strategies and tactics (Glad, 1980; Carter, 1982;
Sick, 1986). This interpretation of Carter's worldview and response repertoire
implies as a test of face validity the hypotheses that his general operational code
should have philosophical elements characterized by a cooperative view of the
political universe (P-1), optimism regarding the realization of political goals (P-2),
but a view of the universe (P-3) as relatively unpredictable due to its complex
interdependence; therefore, even though he may have a relatively strong belief (P-4)
in his ability to control historical development, he attributes a high value to the role
of chance (P-5).

184 Operational Code Analysis
Carter's general operational code should have instrumental elements charac-
terized by a cooperative strategy (I- 1) and cooperative tactical intensity (1-2), plus a risk
orientation that is relatively risk averse because of the complexity of the world. He
should be more acceptant of the risks of submission than deadlock because of a low
propensity to shift his cooperative strategy and tactics (I-4a), though perhaps
moderated by a higher propensity to shift between words and deeds (I-4b) to control
against the risk of being exploited by others. As a cooperative moralist, Carter
should have a propensity to use positive rather than negative sanctions as useful means
(1-5) for exercising power.
The general operational code profile in Table 1 portrays the president as a leader
who exhibits diagnostic propensities that are consistent with a moderately coopera-
tive (+.45) view of the political universe. He is somewhat optimistic (+.32) about
the prospects for realizing his fundamental political values. The president sees the
political universe as somewhat unpredictable (.36). Although he is relatively confi-
dent (.69) in his ability to control political outcomes, President Carter attributes an
important role (.76) to chance in a relatively unpredictable political universe.
President Carter has a very cooperative (+.80) approach to political goals and
pursues them with relatively cooperative (+.58) tactics. He manages risk by employ-
ing a somewhat unpredictable (.35) repertoire of tactics with a high (.80) propensity
to shift between words and deeds. However, the president shows only a modest (.20)
propensity to shift between cooperative and conflictual tactics and clearly prefers
promises (.5 1) and rewards (.3 1) over punishments (.09) and threats (.01) as means
for exercising political power.
This pattern of strategy and tactics indicates that President Carter is relatively
acceptant of the risks of submission to, or exploitation by, others and relatively
averse to the risks associated with provocation or escalation in relations with others.
Overall, he views his relationships in the political universe as mutually cooperative
(+, +) and believes himself to be somewhat more cooperative (+. 18) than others in
the political universe. While this general profile may seem intuitively to be relatively
coherent, the elements in the president's operational code do not necessarily cohere
closely over time or across issue areas.
Construct Validity
We infer from the analyses of others that the general profile of Carter's operational
code should be valid primarily for the first three years of his administration (Carter,

1977; Tucker, 1981; Rosati, 1993; Dumbrell, 1995). It should be qualified regarding
the fourth year because of the catalyzing impact of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
(Rosati, 1987). Preceded by the erosion of domestic public support for his complex
interdependence worldview (Skidmore, 1993-94) and the return to a realpolitik
view of U.S.-Soviet relations by his National Security Advisor (Brzezinski, 1983), the
invasion of Afghanistan changed President Carter's view of the USSR.
We hypothesize, therefore, that our indices of his general operational code should
change as follows. His cooperative view of the political universe (P- 1) should decrease
significantly in a conflictual direction, accompanied by a shift toward less optimism
in the prospects for realizing his political values (P-2). The political universe may
become more predictable (P-3) because the changes in P-I and P-2 may make the
world simpler to interpret. His belief in the ability to control historical development
(P-4) should not increase, thereby limiting a significant change in the role of chance
(P-5).
The instrumental elements in Carter's operational code should change less than
his philosophical elements, because of his strongly held religious beliefs and
interpersonal style, personality traits that generalize to his strategic and tactical
preferences (Etheredge, 1979; Shepard, 1988; see also Walker and Falkowski,
1984a). Therefore, Carter should still be cooperative in his strategy (I-1) and tactics
(1-2) with little or no significant change in these general operational code elements.
His risk orientation may remain generally averse but become relatively more acceptant
of the risk of deadlock as well as submission (1-3). More specifically, he should show
stronger shift propensities between cooperation and conflict (I-4a) and between
words and deeds (I-4b) as he attempts to control conflict. Accompanying these shift
propensities should be a decrease in the utility of positive sanctions and an increase
in negative sanctions as useful means for exercising power (1-5).

in Jimmy Carter's operational code for 1977-79 versus 1980. There is a large and

186 Operational Code Analysis
significant decrease in his cooperative view of the political universe (P-1). One
of the remaining four philosophical elements of the president's code changed
significantly following the invasion of Afghanistan. The optimism index (P-2)
showed a significant (p = .01) decrease. The indices of predictability (P-3),
control over historical development (P-4), and the role of chance (P-5) did not
change significantly.
There is a comparatively small, though significant, decrease in President Carter's
cooperative strategic direction (I- 1) and no significant change in his tactical intensity
(1-2) or in his risk orientation (1-3). The difference in his shift propensity (1-4)
between cooperative and conflictual tactics is significant (p = .03), and there is a
significant difference (p = .02) in the propensity to shift between words and deeds.
There is also a significant decrease (p = .01) in the relative utility of appeals and
increases in the relative utility of negative sanctions (1-5) that approach significance
(p < .10). Finally, the overall summary index from Table 2 for self and other
relationships in Carter's political universe shows a significant (p = .02) shift from a
balanced (+.09), mutually cooperative (+,+) relationship to a skewed (+.34),
mutually cooperative (+,+) relationship characterized by more cooperation attrib-
uted to self than to others following the invasion.
Content Validity
In assessing the content validity of our indices, we use the two aggregate indices for
the philosophical and the instrumental elements to see whether the results in Table
2 change over time by issue area. We do not include in our test the indices for the
remaining elements, which are disaggregated components of the indices for P-1
and I-1. We present the results separately for P-I and I-1, because they are clearly
not related to one another in a regression analysis (p = .87). Our regression analysis
also shows that the relationships are statistically insignificant between all pairs of
philosophical and instrumental indices, confirming their independence from one
another as different sets of operational code elements.
We hypothesize that Carter's worldview (P-1) should shift in a conflictual
direction more for Soviet-American Relations than for Other Issues and perhaps
not at all for Human Rights Issues, which are relatively peripheral to the content
of the other two issue areas. Similarly, we would expect this pattern of change in
his strategy (I-1) for dealing with these issue areas. The latter change may not
be so significant or permanent because of the relative stability of personality-
based, self-attributions compared to updated, information-based attributions
about others. The following analysis reveals that the only major differences in
P-1 and I-1 came in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the
hostage crisis with Iran.
To reach this conclusion, we disaggregated the data in the speeches into three
topical areas for a difference of proportions analysis by issue area: U.S.-Soviet
Relations, Human Rights, and a residual Other Issues category. The results of these
analyses reveal significant differences in Carter's indices before and after Afghani-
stan with one clear exception. His net proportion of cooperative other-attributions
(P-1) decreased significantly (z = 8.13, p < .0001) from .97 to .47 in the U.S.-Soviet
Relations domain and became significantly less cooperative (z = 1.54, p = .001) in
the residual Other Issues category, shifting from .76 to .61. In contrast, his net
other-attributions in the Human Rights issue area moved from .86 to 1.0, becoming
more cooperative (z = 1 .56, p = .06). President Carter's cooperative self-attributions
(I-1) decreased significantly (z = 2.89, p = .002) from 1.0 to .82 in the U.S.-Soviet
domain and from .92 to .84 (z = 2.99, p = .001) in the Other Issues domain.
However, his pattern of self-attributions in the Human Rights domain did not
change significantly (1.0 versus .91, z = 1.04, p = .15).

Finally, we checked the U.S.-Soviet Relations issue area to see if Carter's attribu-
tion patterns varied for 1977 v. 1978-79 v. 1980. The results support the inference
that neither dissensus among the president's advisors (Rosati, 1987) nor the erosion
of public support (Skidmore, 1993-94) altered his views (P-1) or his approach (I-1)
toward the USSR prior to the catalyst provided by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
The attributions were stable for both P- I and I- I between 1977 and 1978-79, varying
between 1.0 and .96, then dropping (1.0 to .82 for P-I and .96 to .41 for I-1) from
1978-79 to 1980. These latter decreases were statistically significant with z-scores
indicating p < .002.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that the indices for the P-I and I-1 elements of the president's
operational code have construct and content validity as well as face validity. That is,
they tend to vary consistently with hypotheses drawn from the historiographical
literature for the Carter presidency. Disaggregating these indices into measures for
the remaining operational code elements yields similar results though the patterns
are not always so strong. Rosati (1987) and Skidmore (1993-94) portray the general
evolution of American foreign policy during the Carter administration as a retreat
from idealism and liberal internationalism back toward realism and containment.
Our analysis detects a shift in this direction for U.S.-Soviet Relations and Other
Issues. The shift toward realism was rather limited, however, as Carter's self-attri-
butions remained generally cooperative following events in Iran and Afghanistan
and also demonstrated a continued commitment to idealism regarding Human
Rights Issues.
Carter's operational code, therefore, retained some continuity in important ways
even though the indices varied significantly over time for different issue areas. The
patterns in Carter's rhetoric indicate that his views of others were susceptible to
greater change than his views of self. The changes in the P-I index were more
dramatic than the shifts in the I-I index. Their independence and the different
patterns of change for the P- I and I-I measures lead us to speculate that other-at-
tribution indices for the philosophical questions may tap relatively malleable
cognitions. In contrast, self-attribution indices for the instrumental questions may
engage relatively more stable, extra-cognitive aspects of the leader's personality or
at least core rather than peripheral beliefs in the leader's operational code. It will
require further research before these issues and other questions are resolved.
