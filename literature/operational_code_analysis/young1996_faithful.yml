model_type: "WorldView enhanced cognitive mapping using semantic‐network formalism"

rationale: >
  Young introduces WorldView to eliminate the limits of adjacency–matrix cognitive maps by
  (a) elevating relationships to nodes within a semantic network,
  (b) differentiating relationship kinds, truth-values and modifiers,
  (c) retaining conjunctions, actions and salience counts,
  (d) supplying a synonym facility and aggregation routines, and
  (e) providing structural and comparative measures (dependency, connectedness, size,
  uniformity of salience, concept comparison, transformation cost, incongruence).

  description: >
    A direct transcription of the representational elements, relationship categories,
    modifiers, truth-values, conjunctions, measures and support features that Young
    explicitly defines for the WorldView system.
  definitions:

    node_types:
      Concept: "Unique term appearing in the text; becomes a node."
      Relationship: "A node that links concepts; carries truth-value, modifier, salience."
      Conjunction: "Node representing 'and' or 'or' used with compound concepts."

    relationship_categories:  # Table 1 and text
      "=":        "equal"
      ">":        "condition component preference / greater-than"
      "+":        "positive-cause"
      "-":        "negative-cause"
      "attribute": "property (attribute) relationship"
      "is-a":      "class inclusion"
      "if-then":   "conditional relationship"
      "possess":   "ownership relationship"
      "strategy":  "means–ends relationship"
      "know":      "knowledge relationship"
      "warrant-for": "justification relationship"
      "location":  "spatial relationship"

    conjunctions:  # Young 1996
      - and
      - or

    salience:
      definition: "Integer count of how often a unique relationship occurs in the data set."

    structural_measures:  # formulas exactly as given
      dependency:
        symbol: "D_G"
        formula: "D_G = ( Σ bridges_G / Σ relationships_G ) / Σ structures_G"
        interpretation: "Vertical organization; proportion of bridges per structure."
      connectedness:
        symbol: "C_G"
        formula: "C_G = Σ relationships_G / ( Σ concepts_G + Σ relationships_G )"
        interpretation: "Degree to which concepts are interrelated."
      size:
        definition: "Count of concepts in the cognitive map."
      uniformity_of_salience:
        definition: "Standard deviation of relationship salience values within the map."

    comparative_measures:
      concept_comparison: "Lists identical, altered and unique concepts across two maps."
      transformation_cost:
        definition: >
          Minimum number of discrete changes (relationship-addition, relationship-deletion,
          salience increment/decrement, concept-deletion, concept-addition) needed to turn
          one map into another; each change has cost 1.
      incongruence:
        definition: >
          Measure combining transformation cost and concept comparison, restricted to
          concepts common to both maps; zero only for identical structures.

    support_features:
      synonym_facility: "User-defined mapping that collapses synonymous concepts during compilation."
      aggregation: "Combines multiple texts or subject responses into a composite map."
      manipulable_map: "Semantic-network format that reasoning models (e.g., directed-walk) can traverse."
