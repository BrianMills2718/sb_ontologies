annotation: Young argues that importing the symbol-rich formalism of semantic networks
  into cognitive mapping yields a more expressive, analyzable representation of political
  belief systems. The WorldView tool demonstrates how richer relationship types, synonym
  handling, and structural metrics can support dynamic models of belief change and
  decision making.

model_type: property_graph
rationale: Key ideas revolve around nodes (concepts), edges (multiple relationship
  types), node/edge attributes, and graph-level metricsâ€”characteristics best captured
  by a labeled property graph.
