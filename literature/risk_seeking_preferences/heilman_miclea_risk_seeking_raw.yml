annotation: "Empirical study investigating the consistency of framing effects across health, financial, and nature/objects decisional domains, finding that framing effects vary both between and within domains, with emotional reactions potentially mediating these effects."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The theoretical framework represents a complex network of psychological constructs, decision-making processes, and domain-specific effects. Nodes represent key concepts like framing effects, risk preferences, decisional domains, and emotional reactions, while edges capture relationships between theoretical constructs, causal mechanisms, and moderating effects. This structure best captures the interconnected nature of prospect theory, framing mechanisms, and domain-specific decision-making processes."
