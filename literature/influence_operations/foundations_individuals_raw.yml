annotation: "This chapter provides theoretical and empirical foundations for individual-level influence operations, examining attitude formation, change mechanisms, cognitive processing models, and systematic approaches to engineering attitude change through various persuasive appeals."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The individual-level influence domain is best represented as a property graph because it involves complex interconnected relationships between cognitive constructs (attitudes, beliefs, values), psychological processes (elaboration, dissonance reduction, social learning), theoretical models, and influence mechanisms. The nodes represent key constructs and entities, while edges capture causal relationships, influence pathways, and theoretical connections between different elements of the influence process."
