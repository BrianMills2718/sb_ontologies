annotation: "Development of the Influence-to-Action Model (I-AM) - a theoretically grounded framework for assessing the relative likelihood of impact of influence operations on target audiences, based on social movement theory and validated through case studies and surveys."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The I-AM represents a complex theoretical framework with interconnected components (individual/internal factors, societal/structural factors, delivery mechanisms, and triggers) that influence behavioral outcomes. A property graph model best captures the relationships between theoretical constructs, measurement variables, validation processes, and impact pathways, including the Influence-to-Action Chain Template (I-ACT) escalation pathway."
