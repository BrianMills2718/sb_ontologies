annotation: "The Influence-to-Action Model (I-AM) is a systematic framework for measuring and assessing the impact and effectiveness of influence operations on target audiences. Grounded in social movement theory and drawing from psychological, sociological, marketing, and communications literature, the model identifies 11 narrative variables that enhance people's propensity to take action rather than passively receive information. The model includes both individual (internal) and societal (structural) level variables and provides a comprehensive assessment tool for analyzing influence operation artifacts across multiple media platforms."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "A property graph model is most appropriate for this theoretical framework because it captures the complex relationships between influence operations, narrative variables, demographic characteristics, and behavioral outcomes. The model represents nodes (influence operations, narrative variables, audience segments, artifacts) connected by edges (causal relationships, assessment processes, demographic effects, behavioral responses). This structure effectively models the multi-level nature of influence operations and the interconnected factors that contribute to their effectiveness."
