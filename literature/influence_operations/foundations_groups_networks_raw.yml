citation: "Foundations of Effective Influence Operations Chapter 3: Influencing Groups and Networks"

annotation: "Chapter analyzing theoretical frameworks and empirical research for influencing group dynamics, decision-making processes, and social networks, covering social power theory, influence models, rational choice perspectives, and social network analysis applications to influence operations."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "Property graph model is optimal for representing the complex web of theoretical constructs, influence mechanisms, group processes, network structures, and their interconnected relationships. The chapter describes multiple overlapping theoretical frameworks with nodes representing concepts, actors, and processes, and edges representing influence relationships, causal mechanisms, and theoretical connections."
