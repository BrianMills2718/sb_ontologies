model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The property graph model effectively captures the complex network of relationships between actors (audiences, practitioners, organizations), influence processes (targeting, messaging, evaluation), strategic methods (advertising, political campaigns, diplomacy), and outcomes. The interconnected nature of influence operations - involving multiple stakeholders, multi-stage processes, and feedback loops - is best represented through nodes representing entities and edges representing relationships and processes."
