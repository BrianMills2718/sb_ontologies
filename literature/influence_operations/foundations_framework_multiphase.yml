annotation: Chapter Six distills a multi-level social-science review into nine planning
  questions that link U.S. strategic aims to concrete influence tactics. It highlights
  the need to map actors, select tailored strategies, and measure outcomes through
  formal analytic models.

model_type: property_graph
rationale: The framework is best represented as a property graph in which actors,
  groups, and audiences are nodes, linked by edges denoting influence, credibility,
  authority, and information flow; node and edge properties capture attributes such
  as salience, attitudes, and resource levels, while actions (e.g., inducements) are
  modeled as labeled relationships or events.
