Executive Summary
Influence operations, or influence campaigns,1 have been a tool for warfare and strategic
geopolitical competition for governments as long as there has been recorded history.
Today, we see firsthand the Chinese government’s efforts to spread disinformation around
the globe about the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as Russia’s efforts to influence
the courses of American social and political futures. Geiger found that mis- and dis-
information have become an increasingly effective tool for nefarious actors to influence
elections, policy, and public sentiment in the United States.2 In other words, influence
operations are an effective and low-cost means for our strategic adversaries and
competitors to advance their goals and agendas.
Given U.S. adversaries’ views of influence operations, and the immense implications and
potential consequences of them, there is an urgent need to advance the state of the art in
measuring and assessing the impact and effectiveness of hostile influence operations. The
Unconventional Weapons and Technology Division (UWT) of the National Consortium for
the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) developed the Influence-to-
Action Model (I-AM) and the prototype Influence-to-Action Campaign/Narrative Impact
Assessment Tool (I-AM Assessment Tool) in an effort to begin to address this issue.
Theoretically grounded in the social movement literature – specifically in social movement
diffusion and the role of threat in social movements – I-AM draws from a variety of
psychological, sociological, marketing, and communications literature, and is designed to
assess the relative likelihood of impact an influence operation would have on the target
audience compared to the likelihood of impact from other influence operations. Some of
the theories and hypotheses that we drew upon to develop the I-AM include cognitive
dissonance, choice certainty, signal detection, dual-process, mere-exposure, and primacy
and recency effects.
To validate our model, we conducted case studies of one historical and two present-day
Russian and Chinese foreign influence operations. The three case studies were chosen to
test I-AM against large-scale, potentially state-sponsored influence operations in different
time periods and of differing state origins to discern if the variables were applicable across
time and space. All three cases were successful in some aspect of influencing either pre-
existing communities or propagating messaging into mainstream media; however, all three
held significant differences. Applying I-AM to these cases, we were able to successfully
analyze all three cases, demonstrating I-AM’s flexibility.

information about an adversary as well as the dissemination of propaganda in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an
opponent.”

Upon completion of the case studies, we fielded two surveys targeting the adult U.S. general
population sample. Through these surveys, we were able to obtain weights associated with
each variable contained in the I-AM. Using these variable weights, the I-AM Assessment Tool
is able to calculate the relative impact an artifact (e.g., an article, a meme, a tweet, etc.) could
potentially have on the U.S. general population compared to other artifacts being examined.
As a prototype, the I-AM Assessment Tool currently employs a High-Medium-Low
assessment metric to assess an artifact’s potential impact on the U.S. general population.
While the current assessment metric does provide the end users information needed to
make decisions and/or recommend future course(s) of action, end users would benefit much
with development and incorporation of a more nuanced and granular assessment metric in
the future iteration of the I-AM Assessment Tool.
Nevertheless, even as a prototype, the I-AM Assessment Tool provides the end users a
systematic methodology that one can use to analyze artifacts collected from across multiple
media types and multiple platforms. This systematic methodology will allow the end users
to conduct consistent analysis of foreign influence operations materials regardless of the
“influencer” and their modes of delivery.

Introduction
Influence operations, or influence campaigns,3 have been a tool for warfare and strategic geopolitical
competition for governments as long as there has been recorded history. Today, we see firsthand the
Chinese government’s efforts to spread disinformation around the globe about the origin of the SARS-
CoV-2 virus, as well as Russia’s efforts to influence the courses of American social and political futures.
Geiger found that mis- and dis-information have become an increasingly effective tool for nefarious
actors to influence elections, policy, and public sentiment in the United States.4 In other words, influence
operations are an effective and low-cost means for our strategic adversaries and competitors to advance
their goals and agendas.
Given U.S. adversaries’ views of influence operations, and the immense implications and potential
consequences of them, there is an urgent need to advance the state of the art in measuring and assessing
the impact and effectiveness of hostile influence operations. The Unconventional Weapons and

Campaign/Narrative Impact Assessment Tool (I-AM Assessment Tool) in an effort to begin to address this

Survey #2 Design and Findings
To further refine Influence-to-Action Model, and to ascertain weights for each of the variables contained in
the model, START designed and fielded a survey #2 for the U.S. general population. This section of the
report describes the survey design, sample characteristics, and findings.
Survey Design and Survey Sample Characteristics
Survey Design
The goal of this survey was to refine the Influence-to-Action Model; therefore, we chose the outcome
variables to be the same 11 narrative variables that the Model utilizes to assess the narrative’s impact on
the target audience. These 11 narrative variables are grouped into two categories – individual (internal)
and societal (structural) level variables. Harkening back to the Model’s grounding in the social movement
theory, narrative variables relevant to threats and identities are conceptualized as threats described in
political process theory as individual (internal) level variables. On the other hand, narrative variables
relevant to opportunities are conceptualized as societal (structural) level variables in the political
process theory perspective. Table 1, below, provides the full list of the narrative variables used as the
outcome variables for this survey:
Variable Name Variable Short Description
Individual (Internal) Level Variables
Emotional Appeal The message either explicitly or implicitly includes an attempt to
appeal to the emotions of the target audience. For example, a
nation-state, in order to entice a specific ethnic diaspora living in
the United States, frames the message in the “perspective” of a
member of that ethnic diaspora and tells the hardship of living in
the United States that most members of the diaspora can identify
with.
Threats to Identity The message either explicitly or implicitly identifies threat(s) to the
commonly perceived/accepted identity of the target audience. For
example, the message clearly identifies that people with certain
ideologies in the United States are not approving of people of
certain ethnicity.
Threats to Culture (Way of
Life)
The message either explicitly or implicitly identifies threat(s) to the
commonly perceived/accepted culture of the target audience. For
example, the message clearly identifies that people with certain
ideologies in the United States are not approving of people living in
a diaspora, who are not assimilating to the “American culture.”
Identity Affirmation The message either explicitly or implicitly conveys that the target
audience is of a certain identity (that aligns with the reader’s
identity), and that you should be proud of your identity.
Victim Affirmation The message either explicitly or implicitly conveys that the target
audience is being victimized due to an aspect of your identity, social
status, economic status, race, ethnicity, etc. For example, the
message implies that people who meet certain criteria are not able
to advance further in the society because another group within
society (e.g., another social class) is systematically placing barriers
to prevent the advancement of those people.
Victimization The message either explicitly or implicitly conveys there is a need
to “right the wrong” or “fight against injustice”; therefore, your
actions against those who have made you a victim are justified.

Variable Name Variable Short Description
Societal (Structural) Level Variables
Persistent and Increasing
Threats
(Things are getting out of
hand)
The message either explicitly or implicitly conveys persistent and
worsening conditions if something is not done to reverse the
course. For example, messaging about potential worsening of
COVID cases and situation around the holidays.
Clear Alternative Future
(World will be better by doing
something about it)
The message either explicitly or implicitly identifies that by taking
action, there is an alternative future where threats against the
target audience will diminish or even be eliminated.
Purported Lack of Response
(Nothing is being done about
it)
The message either explicitly or implicitly identifies that no one is
doing anything to stop and/or reverse the threat against the target
audience.
Clearly Identified In-/Out-
Group
(It is the right thing to do for
the “team”)
The message either explicitly or implicitly identifies there is an in-
group (the one that the target audience belongs to) and (an) out-
group(s), and that one needs to take action because “it is the right
thing to do for the ‘team’.”
Social Validation
(Increases my reputation)
The message explicitly or implicitly states doing something about
the identified injustice is correct, justified, and/or legitimate. The
message may also imply that “everyone is doing it,” and that those
who do are “in the right” and will be “recognized” for doing so.
Table 1: Influence-to-Action Model Variables used as Survey Outcome Variables
For the survey, we utilized two different approaches to determine which variable(s) is/are seen as the
most important variable(s) for people when they decide whether to act based on information they
receive (i.e., the type of message the narrative conveys, or more accurately, the type of message the
participants perceive the narrative conveys).5 First, we asked the survey participants to arrange the two
categories of variables in the order of importance to them, resulting in each participant producing two
ordered list of variables – one for the individual level variables and another for the societal level
variables. Once the participants produced two ordered list of variables, we had the participants conduct
pairwise comparisons of their top three choices from each list utilizing the contingent valuation method.
Through these procedures, we were able to ascertain which narrative variables are self-identified to be
relatively more important compared to other narrative variables.
For our second approach, we asked the participants to consider the 11 narrative variables independently
of each other6 and asked them to utilize a five-point Likert scale that ranged from “strongly disagree” to
“strongly agree” to answer the following prompt: “I will definitely donate my time and/or money to a
cause or movement if the messaging [insert a phrase containing one narrative variable]7.” Through this
procedure we were able to ascertain the impact of each narrative variable on the target audience. We will
present our findings from these two approaches in the Survey Findings section below.
Participant Qualifiers
For this survey, we collected data from 3,049 American adults. To accurately represent the U.S. general
population, we used age, gender, location of residence (according to the U.S. Census regions), and race as
5 This allowed us to address the literature’s shortfall and refine our Influence-to-Action Model by determining which narrative
variables will increase the target audience’s likelihood of action based on their self-identified importance of these variables.
6 To ensure the participants considered each narrative variables independently, we showed the participants one question at a time with
one narrative variable listed per question.
7 For example, the prompt for emotional appeal would read, “I will definitely donate my time and/or money to a cause or movement if
the messaging makes an emotional appeal to me.”

As for how trustworthy the participants felt about the information sources, with 0 being not trustworthy
at all and 10 being completely trustworthy, the participants chose local television stations as being most
trustworthy than any other information sources. Additionally, the participants chose social media (both
social media sources from official media outlets and personal networks) as being least trustworthy.
Finally, the participants seemed to be ambivalent about most information sources listed, with the
trustworthy scores averaging between 5.09 and 5.56. Figure 6, below, provides an illustration of the

Figure 6: Average Trustworthiness by Information Source Type
Since we were interested in whether an individual would act based on the information that he/she/they
receives, we asked the participants what they would do if they came across information that is of interest
to them. Approximately 68%, which was the highest percentage, of the participants responded they
would “Like” that particular post and/or article. The next highest response was that they would post a
comment on the said post and/or article (approximately 55%). Approximately equal percentages of
participants said they would share the information through either public or private forums, share posts
privates via a messaging service, or discuss posts with people offline. Finally, approximately 15% of the
participants (lowest percentage) answered they would do nothing. Figure 7, below, provides an
illustration of the participants’ responses to the question, “What do you do when you come across
information that is interesting to you or that you like? (Select all that apply)”:
Figure 7: Responses to "What do you do when you come across information that is interesting to you or that you like? (Select

As for the methods used most often to share information, if one is to share it, approximately 33% of the
participants responded that they share information most often using a social media platform.
Additionally, approximately 26% of the participants responded that they share information most often
through word of mouth. Furthermore, approximately 16% responded they use Internet chat most often
to share information while approximately 10% said they use email most often as the method of sharing
information. Finally, approximately 13% said they never share, and approximately 2% said they use print
media most often for information sharing. Figure 8 , below, provides an illustration of the participants’

Survey Analysis
As stated above, given the goal of this survey was to refine our Influence-to-Action Model, we chose the
outcome variables to be the same 11 narrative variables that the Model utilizes to assess the narrative’s
impact on the target audience. These 11 narrative variables are grouped into two categories – individual
(internal) and societal (structural) level variables (See Table 1 above for a list of variables). Utilizing two
different approaches in the survey, we were able to ascertain the narrative variables deemed important
by the American public as well as the impact each narrative variable has on the target audience. We
present our detailed survey findings in this section.
Narrative Variable Importance
For determining the narrative variables deemed important by the American public, Threat to culture /
way of life, Identity affirmation, and Victimization were within the margin of error11 of each other for
being the most important narrative variable within the individual level variable category. For the societal
level variables, Clear alternative future (World would be better) and Clearly identified in-/out-group (It is
the right thing to do for the “team”) were within the margin of error of each other for being the most
important narrative variable. Figure 10, below, provides an illustration of the overall percentage each
narrative variable was selected to be the most important variable by the survey participants:
Figure 10: Percentages of Participant-rated Most Important Narrative Variables
An interesting finding for this portion of the survey was that the results for which narrative variable(s)
is/are most important tended to mostly remain consistent regardless of differences in participant
groupings by demographic characteristics. For example, one might hypothesize that participants with
different gender, racial, educational, or political characteristics would designate different narrative
variables as being most important. The survey results showed this not to be the case. While there were
some nuanced variations in the rankings for each demographic group, Threat to culture / way of life,
Identity affirmation, Victimization, Clear alternative future (World would be better), and Clearly identified
in-/out-group (It is the right thing to do for the “team”) were consistently shown to be among the most
chosen variables regardless of the demographic characteristics. Figure 11 thru Figure 15 , all below,
illustrate this trend:
11 Margin of error for the discussion of the survey results is +/- 2% at 95% Confidence Interval unless otherwise specified.

Qualitative Five-point Likert Scale Results
The five-point Likert scale approach, however, provided us with slightly different results. We ascertained
from the Likert scale results that, 1) certain narrative variables (for example, Threat to culture/way of
life) may have a high number of people who placed them as the most important as well as those who did
not place them high on their importance order; and 2) the average Likert scale scores provide us a
qualitatively more accurate sense of which narrative variables are more likely to motivate people toward
action since the scores reflect not only the number of people who may have selected these variables as
most important to them but also the number of people who may not have picked the variables as being
most important to them but would act if they saw the sentiments of the variables conveyed in the
narrative they come in contact with.
The average Likert scale scores showed that the participants were clearly drawn to action by narratives
that conveys Victimization the most, followed by Identity Affirmation, for the individual level variable
category, and Clear alternative future (World would be better) the most, followed by Persistent and
increasing threats (Things are getting out of hand), for the societal level variable category. Threat to
culture/way of life and Clearly identified in-/out-group (It is the right thing to do for the “team”), which
were among the most important variables, were not among the top variables for the average Likert scale
score results. In fact, they were fifth and fourth ranked variables respectively, suggesting that while these
variables may be important, they may be less effective in making people act.
One item of note from the average Likert scale score results was the negative score for the variable Social
validation (Increases my reputation), suggesting that people will most likely be “turned off” – which would
mean that it would decrease the likelihood for people to act – by narratives that attempt to convey, either
explicitly or implicitly, that one should act based on the potential for social validation. Figure 16, below,
provides a detailed information on the average Likert score results for the narrative variables:

Figure 16: Average Likert Scale Scores for Full Sample
Same with the results for the most important variables above, the results for the Likert scale also showed
that the results mostly remained consistent regardless of differences in participant groupings by
demographic characteristics. While, again, there were some nuanced variations in the rankings for each
demographic group, Victimization and Clear alternative future (World would be better) were consistently
shown to be the variables with the highest average Likert scale scores for their respective variable
categories regardless of the demographic characteristics. Additionally, Identity affirmation and Persistent
and increasing threats (Things are getting out of hand) were consistently shown to be the variables with
second highest average Likert scale scores for their respective variable categories regardless of the
demographic characteristics. Figure 17 thru Figure 21, all below, illustrate this trend:

Narrative Variable Impact
To determine each narrative variable’s degree of impact, we employed multi-way multivariate analysis of
variance (MANOVA) method to analyze the survey data. The analyses found all narrative variables have a
role in influencing the target audience to act (or not act) given the target audience’s specific demographic
characteristics. First, we found that participants who are 55 year of age and above are less likely to act
based on the narrative that appeals to one’s emotion compared to other age groups. We also found that
messages that convey social validation as the motivation for action does not resonate with the 55 years
and older group – we also found this to be the narrative variable with the most effect on this group. All

other narrative variables had no significant effect on the target population based on the individual’s age.

Table 3: Narrative Variables with Statistically Significant Effects based on Age Group
Examining the participants’ responses by gender, we found three narrative variables to be statistically
significant for this demographic characteristic – emotional appeal, clear alternative future, and social
validation. For emotional appeal and clear alternative future, we found that male participants are less
likely to act compared to female participants; however, male participants were shown to be more likely
to act based on the narrative that conveys social validation than female participants. Of all the narrative
variables, social validation was found to be the only statistically significant variable where male
participants were more likely to act based on the message. All other narrative variables had no significant
effect on the target population based on the individual’s gender. Table 4, below, shows the narrative

Table 4: Narrative Variables with Statistically Significant Effects based on Gender
An examination based on the participants’ self-identified racial groups revealed emotional appeal, threat
to identity, identity affirmation, and victimization had statistically significant effect for those who
identified themselves as black or Hispanic/Latinx. Blacks and Hispanic/Latinx were more likely to act
based on narratives that conveys aforementioned variables compared to other racial groups. In addition
to the narrative variables mentioned immediately above, victim affirmation, purported lack of response,
clearly defined in-/out-group(s), and social validation also had statistically significant effects on black
participants, all making them more likely to act. Of these, social validation was shown to have the most
effect on black participants. Also, threat to culture/way of life was shown to have statistically significant
effect on Hispanic/Latinx participants in addition to those narrative variables identified above. Of the
narrative variables that were shown to have statistically significant effect for Hispanic/Latinx
participants, identity affirmation was shown to have the most effect for the group. Finally, all other
narrative variables had no significant effect on the target population based on the individual’s race. Table

Threat to culture/way of life was the only narrative variable shown to have any statistically significant
effect on the participants based on their region of residence. The results showed participants that reside
in the South were more likely to be affected by narratives that convey threat to culture/way of life than
those who reside elsewhere in the United States. Table 6, below, shows the narrative variable with

An individual’s education level was another demographic characteristic where only one narrative
variable had an effect. Purported lack of response was shown to be the only narrative variable to have any
statistically significant effect on this demographic characteristic. The results showed participants with
college or higher degrees were more likely to be affected by narratives that convey purported lack of
response than those without college degrees. Table 7, below, shows the narrative variable with

Clear alternative future, purported lack of response, and social validation were shown to have statistically
significant effects on those participants who have experienced financial difficulties in their lives
compared to those who self-identified they have never experienced financial difficulties. Those who have
experienced financial difficulties were more likely to react to narratives that convey clear alternative
future and purported lack of response while being turned off by narratives that convey social validation as
the motivation for action. Social validation was shown to have the most effect for the participants who
have experienced financial difficulties. All other narrative variables were shown not to be significant for
this demographic characteristic. Table 8, below, shows the narrative variables with statistically

An individual’s employment status was yet another demographic characteristic where only one narrative
variable had an effect. Social Validation was shown to have statistically significant effects on those who
are employed part- and full-time compared to those who are unemployed and/or retired. The results
showed those who are employed part-time were most likely to act on narratives that convey social
validation as motivation when compared to those who are employed full-time or those who are
unemployed and/or retired. All other narrative variables were shown not to be significant for this
demographic characteristic. Table 9, below, shows the narrative variables with statistically significant

Exploration of how the narrative variables would affect the participants based on their religious
inclinations showed that threat to identity, identity affirmation, victim affirmation, clear alternative future,
clearly defined in-/out-group(s), and social validation had statistically significant effects for this
demographic characteristic. The results showed that those who identified themselves as being religious
were more likely to act on narratives that convey the sentiments portrayed by the narrative variables
mentioned above than those who identified themselves as being not religious. Clearly defined in-/out-
group(s) (It is right thing to do for the “team”) was shown to have the most effect for the participants who

Exploration of how the narrative variables would affect the participants based on their political
inclinations showed that emotional appeal, identity affirmation, victimization, persistent and increasing
threat, clear alternative future, and purported lack of response had statistically significant effects on this
demographic characteristic. Interestingly, all of the statistically significant effects for this demographic
characteristic were negative, meaning that narratives conveying these narrative variables will make
people who identify themselves as moderate/middle of the road or conservative less likely to act
compared to those who identify themselves as liberal. For those identified as moderate or conservative,
clear alternative future was shown to have the most effect (in the negative direction). All other narrative
variables were shown not to be significant for this demographic characteristic. Table 11, below, shows

Finally, we examined demographic characteristic identity fusion index. For this demographic
characteristic, those who identified themselves as being closest to index C, D, and E shared three common
narrative variables that showed as having statistically significant effects – identity affirmation,
victimization, and clear alternative future. For those who identified themselves as being closest to index D,
threat to culture/way of life was also found to have statistically significant effect. In addition to the three
common narrative variables identified above, those who identified themselves as being closest to index E
were also affected by victim affirmation, persistent and increasing threat, purported lack of response, and
clearly defined in-/out-groups(s). For those who identified themselves as index C and E, identity
affirmation was shown to have the most effect on their decision to act while threat to culture/way of life
was shown to have the most effect for those who identified themselves as index D. All other narrative
variables were shown not to be significant for this demographic characteristic. Table 12, below, shows

Survey Findings
Through this survey, we found that Threat to culture / way of life (approximately 19%), Identity
affirmation (approximately 18%), and Victimization (approximately 18%) were within the margin of
error12 of each other for being the most important narrative variable within the individual level variable
category. For the societal level variables, Clear alternative future (World would be better) – approximately
25% – and Clearly identified in-/out-group (It is the right thing to do for the “team”) – approximately 24%
– were within the margin of error of each other for being the most important narrative variable.

From the five-point Likert scale portion of the survey, we were able to ascertain average Likert scale
scores for each narrative variables and gain a sense of which narrative variables are more likely to
motivate people toward action, which is different from simply asking which variable does one consider to
be most important. The Likert scale provides us a more accurate sense of which narrative variables are
more likely to motivate people toward action since the scores from the scale reflect not only the number
of people who may have selected these variables as most important to them but also the number of
people who may not have picked the variables as being most important to them but would still act if they
saw the sentiments of the variables conveyed in the narrative they come in contact with. The average
Likert scale scores showed that the participants were clearly drawn to action by narratives that conveys
Victimization (average Likert scale score 0.81) the most, followed by Identity Affirmation (average Likert
scale score 0.77), for the individual level variable category, and Clear alternative future (World would be
better) – average Likert scale score 1.03 – the most, followed by Persistent and increasing threats (Things
are getting out of hand) – average Likert scale score 0.96 – for the societal level variable category. Threat
to culture/way of life and Clearly identified in-/out-group (It is the right thing to do for the “team”), which
were among the most important variables, were not among the top variables for the average Likert scale
score results. In fact, they were fifth and fourth ranked variables respectively, suggesting that while these
variables may be important to people, they may be less effective in making people act. One item of note
from the average Likert scale score results was the negative score for the variable Social validation
(Increases my reputation) – average Likert scale score of -0.50, suggesting that people will most likely be
“turned off”, meaning that it would decrease the likelihood for people to act, by narratives that attempt to
convey, either explicitly or implicitly, that one should act based on the potential for social validation.
Additionally, we were able to determine the different impact each narrative variable has on the
participants based on different aspects of their demographic characteristics. From this, we found that
social validation has the most statistically significant effects on those who are ages 55 and older, those
who identified themselves as black, those who have experienced financial difficulties, those who are
employed part-time, and those who are employed full-time. Additionally, we found that identity
affirmation has the most statistically significant effects on those who identified themselves as
Hispanic/Latinx, identity fusion index C, and identity fusion index E. Threat to culture/way of life was
found to have the most statistically significant effects for those who reside in the Southern region of the
United States and those who identify themselves with identity fusion index D. Clear alternative future was
found to have the most statistically significant effects for males, those who identify themselves as
politically moderate, and those who identify themselves as politically conservative. Purported lack of
response was found to have a statistically significant effect for those who hold an undergraduate degree
or above. Finally, clearly defined in-/out-group(s) was shown to have statistically significant effect on
those who identify themselves as being religious.
Also, an interesting finding from the survey is that the trends for the most important narrative variables
and the Likert scale responses were generally consistent across all demographic characteristics,
suggesting that the survey participants had fairly similar feelings and values when internalizing and
interpreting each narrative variable’s definitions. For example, clear alternative future (world would be
better if something is done) was seen as a motivator for action regardless of demographic characteristics.
One should not, however, interpret this trend as the American public believing in or having the same idea
of what a better world looks like. Instead, one should interpret this trend as the American public believes
in a better future in general but what that “better future” looks like may be very different from one
individual or group to the next. Given that the initiators of the influence operation often do not care how

people react to the narratives as long as people react to them, the narratives and ensuing reactions serve
to sew confusion and discontent in the society.
Finally, the survey allowed us to determine the effects of each narrative variable on the target audience.
Utilizing these results, we were able to refine our Influence-to-Action Model and ascertain the weights for
each variable of the model as applied to the U.S. general adult population. These weights will be used for
in our development of the Influence-to-Action Assessment Tool.

Influence-to-Action Campaign/Narrative Impact Assessment Tool
The final step/product of this research was the development and instantiation of Influence-to-Action
Campaign/Narrative Impact Assessment Tool (I-AM Assessment Tool) prototype. The I-AM Assessment
Tool is intended to provide a systematic methodology to analyze and assess artifacts collected from
across multiple media types and multiple platforms (e.g., an article, a meme, a tweet, etc.). The following
section of this report describes the development of the prototype I-AM Assessment Tool.
Prototype Tool Development Process
Following the completion of the survey analysis process, the research team met for a two-day workshop
to brainstorm the design and functionality of the I-AM Assessment Tool. Basing our initial design on
previously successful tools designed by the START team, we decided on an Excel-based design where an
analyst could evaluate artifacts and each variable is rated on a numerical scale. We decided to build the
scale around individual artifacts as that provides the greatest flexibility of use for the tool. From our
initial discussions we wanted to build a tool that could be used to compare not only artifacts within a
specific campaign or narrative, but also to compare artifacts from multiple narratives, multiple time
periods, and across multiple artifact types. The types of artifacts we wanted the tool to be useful for
include images (e.g., memes, screenshots, etc.), short form writing (e.g., tweets, comments, etc.), blogs or
news articles, long-form writing (e.g., journal articles, books, etc.), audio, and video, as well as forms of
mixed media (to include comments on videos, chat between users, etc.). During the workshop, we also
determined that the tool could be used for any number of artifacts, whether to be used as a quick check
for a very small number of artifacts or used to aggregate and understand very large numbers of artifacts.
To be able to investigate all these desired artifact mediums, comparative factors, and quantities, we first
needed to develop a coding schema for the variables.
The first step to develop the numerical scale and coding schema was to look at each variable and the
variables in total to determine an appropriate schema. Following a discussion of multiple ways to
rank/score the variables, we chose to use a scale from 0-3 as this scale provided the flexibility for
analysts to approximate the appropriate number for each variable as related to an artifact without
overcomplicating the process. Our goal was to remain inclusive while simultaneously avoiding excessive
granularity. Excessive measurement metrics tend to increase the level of complexity associated with the
determination of values, especially in the face of intrinsically uncertain information without adding
significant benefit to the effort to characterize artifacts. As the goal of the tool was to remain unbiased
regarding messaging present in artifacts, we determined a 0-3 scale was the best option.
We then discussed the specific scheme for each variable and noticed some key similarities that could be
generalized across all variables that would simplify the scale. In our discussions, we also determined that
this generalized scoring could be communicated using emojis which would further boost the ease of
rememberability for each score. For every variable, a “0” would represent that the variable was not
present in the artifact, a “1” would indicate that the variable may be present but is not explicitly stated, a
“2” would represent an indirect but positive identification of the variable, and a “3” would represent a
direct statement of the variable present. These scoring once simplified to one-two word descriptions,
shown in Table 13, below, would allow analysts, once comfortable with the variable definitions to have a
quick reference schema to remember when coding and will increase the probability of consistent coding
among different analysts. However, there is some nuance between these variables that required specific
definitions and examples for each variable.

0 = �� No
1 = ���� Maybe
2 = ������ Yes, Indirect
3 = ✅ Yes, Direct
Table 13: Quick Variable Reference Guide
We then discussed and took notes on how each score would be defined for every variable. Here we
noticed and discussed something that would simplify the extended definitions for the internal variables
further, that the scores of “0”, “1”, and “2” were uniform across all internal variables. Therefore, we
determined that for the internal variables all scores of “0” would be defined as, “Variable cannot be
identified in the narrative,” all scores of “1” would be defined as, “Cannot definitively identify that the
variable is not present,” and all scores of “2” would be defined as, “The narrative does not specify the
Variable you are coding for, but certain audience(s) will take it as directed towards them.” For a score of
“1”, we decided to define that variable as stating that the variable cannot be determined to be present, as
it is easier to determine with higher confidence that a variable is present than not. This definition
therefore allows coders to more confidently state that they cannot confirm the absence of the variable.
This will allow for the covering of inherent ambiguity when coding for artifacts of an influence campaign
or narrative targeted at a group that the analyst may not be as intricately familiar with. For example,
messaging could not specifically or indirectly contain an emotional appeal, but the analyst could not
precisely determine if a group would ascertain an emotional message from the artifact, therefore a coding
of “1” does not eliminate the possibility of an emotional appeal entirely.
For the score of “3” within the internal variables, we defined each variable so that the variable is directly
stated within the artifact. The final definitions for the internal variables at score “3” are listed below in
Table 14. For each variable, the definition is slightly changed to account for how the variable was listed in
the surveys and other deliverables. For example, for Threats to Identity a score of “3” is defined as,
“Messaging conveys imminent threat to a specific identity,” whereas for Victim Affirmation a score of “3”
is defined as, “Messaging affirms that a specific identity/culture is a target of an external assault.” By
defining the variables based on the nuance within the definitions, analysts will have a better
understanding of what to look for regarding each variable. The full list of variables and definitions can be
found within the tool.
Internal Variables Score 3 Definitions
Emotional Appeal 3 = ✅ Yes, Direct Messaging makes an emotional appeal to the
target
Threats to Identity 3 = ✅ Yes, Direct Messaging conveys imminent threat to a
specific identity
Threats to Culture
(Way of Life) 3 = ✅ Yes, Direct Messaging conveys imminent threat to a
specific way of life and/or culture
Identity Affirmation 3 = ✅ Yes, Direct Messaging affirms a specific identity
Victim Affirmation 3 = ✅ Yes, Direct
Messaging affirms that a specific
identity/culture is a target of an external
assault
Victimization 3 = ✅ Yes, Direct Messaging conveys the need to “right the
wrong” or “fight against injustice”

Table 14: Internal Variables Score 3 Definitions
For the structural/societal variables we again determined that the score of “0” would be defined as,
“Variable cannot be identified in the narrative.” However, for the additional scores 1-3, each score for
every societal variable required a unique definition. We then defined each variable for those scores and
included a brief clarifying definition to each variable generally and an example within scores 1-3 for each
variable as well. Those definitions and examples are described in Table 15 below:
Societal (Structural) Level Variables Score 1-3 Definitions and Examples
Persistent and
Increasing
Threats
(Things are
getting out of
hand)
1 = ���� Maybe Threat is stated, but directionality of its persistence is not given
(e.g., current, general statement about COVID)
2 = ������ Yes,
Indirect
A threat is stated, and it is implied it is persistent and/or
increasing (e.g., statement of a COVID new variant announced)
3 = ✅ Yes,
Direct
Messaging conveys persistent and worsening conditions if
something is not done to reverse the course (e.g., COVID
messaging around the holidays)
Clear
Alternative
Future
(World would
be better by
doing
something
about it)
1 = ���� Maybe Messaging identifies a need to change the future but does specify
the direction (e.g., saving money for your kids)
2 = ������ Yes,
Indirect
No good alternative future can be identified, but the messaging
implies there will be one (e.g., decrease use of fossil fuels)
3 = ✅ Yes,
Direct
Message clearly states a good alternative future (e.g., use more
renewable energy to build a healthier future for our kids)
Purported
Lack of
Response
(Nothing is
being done
about it)
1 = ���� Maybe Not enough is being done (e.g., politicians are not acting in regard
to student loans)
2 = ������ Yes,
Indirect
Something is being done, but more needs to happen (implying
you need to be involved) (e.g., we need to support our politicians
in the fight against gun control)
3 = ✅ Yes,
Direct
Messaging conveys that “no one” is doing anything about the
problem, so you need to (e.g., no one is ensuring the safety of our
children in school, so you need to call your representatives now
and demand action)
Clearly
Identified In-
/Out-Group
(It is the right
thing to do for
the "team")
1 = ���� Maybe Implies or states there are multiple teams (e.g., our side is
fighting…)
2 = ������ Yes,
Indirect

eco warriors, are we just going to sit around and wait for policy
change?)
3 = ✅ Yes,
Direct
It is the right thing for “the team” (e.g., our team needs you to
step up and demand action for our core values)
Social
Validation 1 = ���� Maybe Implies there is a reputation to be had (e.g., our most respected
members are doing this…)

Prototype Tool Development Results
Using this coding schema, we instantiated the tool (shown in Appendix C: Blank Influence-to-Action
Campaign/Narrative Impact Assessment Tool) into a single table where an analyst could input the value
for each variable. Additionally, we included administrative material rows to the beginning of the table to
include a reference numbering column, campaign or narrative name column, and a date-time group
column. For each artifact, there would be eleven columns for each variable, divided by internal versus
societal level variables, with each cell preset to accept numerical inputs of 0-3. Finally, there would be a
column that will automatically populate an aggregate score for the artifact using the weights of each
variable as described previously.
These weights and the scoring schema of 0-3 provided us with possible scores ranging from 0-21.45 for
each artifact. From this range, we determined the threshold for the Campaign/Narrative Impact Index
would be separated into three equally divided tiers, with the first tier representing the highest impact
(aggregate scores from 14.301 to 21.45), the second tier representing a modest impact (aggregate scores
from 7.151 to 14.30), and the third tier representing little or no impact (aggregate scores from 0 to 7.15).
We additionally color-coded the tiers to create a quick visual reference as to which tier an artifact falls
into. These tiers are described in Table 17 below.
Campaign/Narrative Impact Index Tiers

Range: 14.301-21.45 7.151-14.30 0-7.15

The tool was specifically designed to be artifact agnostic and as such useful for the media types described
previously and across a variety of purposes that include one artifact for multiple narratives, multiple
UNCLASSIFIED//APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE (13 JULY 2022)
Influence-to-Action Model and Impact Assessment Tool 31
UNCLASSIFIED//APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE (13 JULY 2022)
artifacts for one narrative, and multiple artifacts for multiple artifacts based around a specific theme,
movement, time-period, or event. The initial version of the tool additionally included a page of variable
definitions, identical to Table 1, and the codebook which was comprised of the variable coding schemas
described prior. At this point, we conducted both internal and external testing of the tool using artifacts
that represented a range of narratives, shown in Appendix D.
Prototype Tool Testing and Results
Our initial test of the tool included five screenshot image artifacts (specifically memes) surrounding
multiple narratives. In selecting the images, we sought diversity in terms of targeted group or ideology,
reliability of the source, and format to cover a variety of narrative themes in order to utilize narratives
from groups or ideologies that the testers would have a range of knowledge regarding.
These images and the resulting average scores are shown in Appendix D. We performed both internal and
external testing of these images and then held discussions with both the internal and external testers to
determine the strengths and weaknesses of the current tool iteration. These discussions revealed that the
tool was effective and was easy to use, but that there were some slight formatting quirks and two
supplemental items missing. These included an expanded instruction sheet and an additional linked tab
where analysts could provide notes and justifications for each decision. We therefore compiled our
existing instructions, some of which had thus far been only verbally communicated, into a cohesive
instructional document. The full instructions can be found in Appendix E: Tool Instructions.
Additionally, a tab was added entitled, “Analyst Notes & Justifications,” which we designed to match the
columns from the main assessment tool with blank cells for analysts to record their decision-making
process and justifications for each variable. The included administrative information columns were
designed to automatically populate with the information entered in the main tool tab for easy reference
between cases coded across the two documents. We also linked to each variable heading on this tab from
each variable heading from the main tool to allow easier movement between the tabs.
Following these revisions to the tool, the second version of the tool was then finalized the Influence-to-
Action Campaign/Narrative Impact Assessment Tool prototype.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The current literature on influence operations fails to address the impact and/or effectiveness of foreign
influence operations on the target audience, specifically what factor(s) of the messaging is/are more likely to
cause the target audience to act. As we sought to address this issue, we were able to identify several variables
from psychological, sociological, marketing, and communications literature that have been shown to enhance
people’s propensity to participate in action rather than simply receive passively. The literature, however, does
not provide how these variables impact the actions of the target audience. Through the development of the I-
AM, followed by several model validation case studies, and two rounds of public surveys, we were able to
develop and instantiate the I-AM Assessment Tool prototype. Designed to measure various components of
influence operation artifacts with the goal to provide a systematic methodology to analyze and assess artifacts
collected from across multiple media platforms, end users can employ the assessment tool to assess images
(e.g., memes, screenshots, etc.), short form writing (e.g., tweets, comments, etc.), blogs or news articles,
long-form writing (e.g., journal articles, books, etc.), audio, and video, as well as forms of mixed media (to
include comments on videos, chat between users, etc.).
At the moment, the assessment tool currently employs a High-Medium-Low assessment metric to assess an
artifact’s potential impact on the U.S. general population. While the current assessment metric does
provide the end users information needed to make decisions and/or recommend future course(s) of
action, end users would benefit much with development and incorporation of a more nuanced and
granular assessment metric in the future iteration of the I-AM Assessment Tool. Nevertheless, even as a
prototype, the I-AM Assessment Tool provides the end users a systematic methodology that one can use
to analyze artifacts collected from across multiple media types and multiple platforms. This systematic
methodology will allow the end users to conduct consistent analysis of foreign influence operations
materials regardless of the “influencer” and their modes of delivery
If there is an opportunity, further development of this tool will provide the U.S. military, intelligence
community, and other government stakeholders a method to systematically measure the relative impact and
effectiveness of foreign influence operations being conducted against the United States so that the United States
national security enterprise can more effectively prepare for, counter, and neutralize nefarious influence
operations.

Appendix E: Influence-to-Action Assessment Tool Instructions
Instructions
Usable artifacts
This tool has been designed to be used across a variety of artifact types including images (e.g., memes, screen-shots,
etc.), short-form writing (e.g., tweets, comments, etc.), blogs or news articles, long-form writing (e.g. journal articles,
books, etc.), audio, and video, as well as forms of mixed-media (to include comments on videos, chat between users,
etc.). There is no minimum number of artifacts required to make this a useful tool. It can be used as a quick check for
a very small number of artifacts or used to aggregate and understand very large numbers of artifacts.
Finding and storing artifacts
Compile a selection of artifacts to be used for coding. It is helpful for the person compiling the artifacts not be the
person coding, but is not required. It is important to make sure that the artifacts to be coded are stored somewhere
that they can be accessed later, in case the artifacts are removed from their original source.
Familiarize yourself with the
variable definitions
Please read through the definitions of each variable, paying particular attention to the differences between those
with similar names or similar themes (e.g., victimization v. victim affirmation). Make sure that you are familiar with
the definitions of these terms and use the provided examples to enhance your understanding.
Read through the codebook
Read through the codebook. The scorings are generally consistent across the board in regard to the simplified coding
schema of 0 = no; 1 = maybe; 2 = yes, indirect; 3 = yes; direct, however there are nuances for each variable, so a close
examination is necessary. Note that the scorings of 0 and 1 are the same for all internal variables and the scoring of 0
is the same for all structural variables. The variables are all generally similar across variables for the scorings of 2 or
3 and are primarily based in whether the specific variable is implied or directly stated within the artifact.
Understand your specific
purpose and goal for using the
tool
This tool has been designed to be used for a variety of purposes depending on the desired outcome of use. Some
examples are described below:
One artifact for
multiple narratives
This tool can be used to compare the effectiveness of singular artifacts across a range of
narratives to determine what messaging may be more prolific than others in terms of
generating action* within a population subset. For example, the tool could be used to look at a
variety of artifacts coming from one twitter profile or a specific hate-group to determine
where their counter-messaging campaigns should focus.
Multiple artifacts
for one narrative
The tool can be used to compare artifacts within a campaign or group of narratives to help
determine what messaging may be more prolific in terms of generating action* within the
campaign's targeted population
Multiple artifacts
for multiple
narratives based
around a specific
theme, movement,
or event
The tool can additionally be used with for more complicated analysis using multiple artifacts
across multiple narratives, but for comparative purposes should be focused on a specific
theme, movement, or event. The tool used in this manner can help analysts narrow down their
focus on more specific types of messaging within a broader or global event. For example, this
tool could be used to analyze artifacts with different messaging, from different angles or
sources, and directed at different audiences, but with the overall theme of COVID-19 vaccine
development.

Instructions
Important reminders
1. When coding, only use what is provided by the artifact. Do not infer potential meaning from the intended target
audience or possible emotional responses from either the intended audience or opposing groups.
2. It is helpful to have multiple analysts code at least a sample of the artifacts to ensure consistent coding throughout.
3. Have the variable definitions and codebook available during coding in order to ensure consistent coding across the
variables.
Coding
Begin coding by going through the tool one variable at a time for each artifact, coding your scoring 0-3 for each
variable and providing justification for that score. The aggregate scoring will be automatically calculated at the far
right of the tool and will provide a composite score for the artifact that is color-coded as described below.
Ranges and ranking
The tool automatically calculates a composite score for each artifact on the right, based on statistical weights that
were determined by an American general population survey conducted by START at the University of Maryland.**
The scores are sorted into three categories, marked by the color of the cell, with red having the highest score range
and blue the lowest score range, as listed below. These color coding is designed to provide an easy visualization for
the analysts on where the artifact scored on the scale for the tool as well as easy comparison between the artifacts on
how they scored compared to each other.
Range: 1st Tier = 14.301-21.45 2nd Tier = 7.151-14.30 3rd Tier = 0-
7.15
Analyzing results
The ranges of scores and tiers indicate the potential for that artifact to sway consumers of the artifact into action. *
The 1st tier (red) indicates a higher likelihood of action being taken as a result of consuming the artifact. The 2nd tier
(yellow) indicates some potential for action and the 3rd tier (blue) indicates the lowest potential for action occurring
from consuming that particular artifact. When looking across various artifacts, these ranges/tiers provide a ranking
of artifacts that can inform analysts of what types of artifacts/messaging to focus their attention on or to further
investigate.
* Action refers to an outwardly observable act that is in direct/indirect response to the influence conveyance tool(s) (i.e., messaging) being presented to the target. For
this research, term Action can be used interchangeably with the term mobilization. Further, we conceptualize “action” on a continuum of activities that range from “low
intensity” active online participation to “high intensity” violence in the physical world.
