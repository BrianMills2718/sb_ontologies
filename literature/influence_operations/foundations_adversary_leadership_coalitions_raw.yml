annotation: "A strategic framework for influence operations targeting adversary leadership coalitions through indirect strategies, stakeholder analysis, and agent-based rational choice modeling, emphasizing expected utility models for predicting political outcomes and identifying leverage points."

model_type: "property_graph"

rationale: "The chapter presents a complex network of stakeholder relationships, coalition dynamics, bargaining processes, and strategic interactions that are best represented as a property graph. The model captures nodes representing stakeholders, coalitions, strategies, and outcomes, with edges representing influence relationships, bargaining dynamics, and strategic interactions. This structure effectively models the multi-actor political processes and decision-making systems described in the framework."
