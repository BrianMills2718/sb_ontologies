It integrates rational\u2013choice modelling, attitude-structure measurement, and communication theory to show planners how to identify high-payoff stakeholders, craft differentiated message campaigns, and manage dose\u2013response trade-offs over time and across conflict phases.  The chapter\u2019s theoretical contribution is a multi-level, metrics-driven schema that connects individual cognitive processes, group dynamics, and mass-public persuasion with operational design and adaptive assessment.",
