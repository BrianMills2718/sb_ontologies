annotation: Chapter 6 synthesises a broad social-science literature into a practical,
  nine-question planning framework that links U.S. political-military objectives to
  concrete influence substrategies, diagnostic tools, and assessment methods.  It
  integrates rational–choice modelling, attitude-structure measurement, and communication
  theory to show planners how to identify high-payoff stakeholders, craft differentiated
  message campaigns, and manage dose–response trade-offs over time and across conflict
  phases.  The chapter’s theoretical contribution is a multi-level, metrics-driven
  schema that connects individual cognitive processes, group dynamics, and mass-public
  persuasion with operational design and adaptive assessment.
model_type: property_graph
rationale: The theory is not a simple hierarchy, ordered sequence, or tidy matrix;
  instead it interweaves many heterogeneous entity classes (operations, stakeholders,
  objectives, messages, attitude structures, metrics, planning questions, curves)
  with a rich set of lateral relations (targets, measures, influences, employs, maps-to,
  etc.). A property-graph best supports these many-to-many, multi-level, richly-attributed
  links and allows quantitative edge/node properties required for dose–response analytics.

    Schema
  description: This schema captures the RAND framework that links U.S. political-military
    objectives to concrete influence substrategies through nine planning questions,
    multi-level attitudes, stakeholder features, messaging actions, and dose-response
    assessment. It must support heterogeneous actors, cognitive structures, quantitative
    metrics, and phase-specific modifiers while preserving fine-grained relationships
    across individual, group, and mass-public levels.
