annotation: Young introduces WorldView, a computer-assisted content-analysis and modeling
  system that merges cognitive mapping with the symbol-based formalism of semantic
  networks.  By enlarging the repertoire of representable relationships (truth-values,
  temporal and modal modifiers, differentiated links, action predicates) and by adding
  structural and comparative metrics, WorldView enables richer descriptions of belief
  systems and supplies manipulable semantic-network data structures for process models
  of reasoning and policy choice.
model_type: property_graph
rationale: The theory’s core representation is a semantic network of concepts and
  propositions linked by many qualitatively different relationships that carry salience
  values, truth values, and temporal/modal modifiers.  These rich, typed, many-to-many
  connections – plus additional action/process links – are modelled most naturally
  as a property graph.  Alternatives such as table_matrix (for typologies), tree (for
  hierarchies) or timeline (for historical evolution) would lose the central emphasis
  on heterogeneous relational structure.

  title: WorldView Cognitive-Mapping Semantic-Network Schema
  description: A property-graph schema for representing the enriched cognitive maps,
    semantic networks, analytical tools, and reasoning processes described in Young
    (1996).  The schema captures typed concept nodes, highly differentiated relationship
    edges with salience, truth and temporal/modal qualifiers, as well as process/action
    edges that trace WorldView’s analytic and inferential operations.  It supports
    structural metrics (size, dependency, connectedness, etc.) as properties on CognitiveMap
    nodes.
