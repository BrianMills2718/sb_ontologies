annotation: Lofland and Stark propose a seven-stage, value-added sequence that explains
  how individuals convert to a deviant religious outlook, moving from personal tension
  through intensive interaction to become active propagators. Their model highlights
  how structural conditions and interpersonal ties filter and transform potential
  recruits into committed cult members.

  of Conversion to a Deviant Perspective." American Sociological Review 30(6): 862-875.'
model_type: sequence
rationale: The theory is explicitly structured as a fixed temporal/causal sequence
  of seven cumulative conditions, so a sequence model best captures the ordered logic
  and gate-like progression required for conversion.
