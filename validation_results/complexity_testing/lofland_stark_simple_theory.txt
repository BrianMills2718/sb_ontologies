Becoming a World-Saver: A Theory of Conversion to a Deviant Perspective
John Lofland and Rodney Stark (1965)

Abstract and Core Theory

This paper develops a "value-added" model of the conditions under which conversion to deviant perspectives occurs. For conversion a person must experience, within a religious problem-solving perspective, enduring, acutely-felt tensions that lead him to define himself as a religious seeker; he must encounter the cult at a turning point in his life; within the cult an affective bond must be formed (or pre-exist) and any extra-cult attachments must be neutralized; and there he must be exposed to intensive interaction if he is to become a "deployable agent."

Value-Added Model Structure

The analysis is based on a "value-added" conception - a series of seven successively accumulating factors, which in their total combination account for conversion. All seven factors are necessary for conversion, and together they appear to be sufficient conditions.

The sequential arrangement of the seven conditions may be conceived as a funnel that systematically reduces the number of persons who can be considered available for recruitment. Each condition narrows the range of potential converts.

The Seven Conditions for Conversion

1. Tension: Acutely felt tension characterized as a felt discrepancy between some imaginary, ideal state of affairs and the circumstances in which people see themselves caught up. This creates disposition to act but may be resolved in various ways.

2. Religious Problem-Solving Perspective: The person must be inclined to define problems in religious terms and seek religious solutions. This perspective must exist prior to encounter with the cult.

3. Seekership: The person must come to define himself as a religious seeker - someone actively looking for some satisfactory system of religious meaning to interpret and resolve his discontent.

4. Turning Point: The person must encounter the cult at a turning point in his life - a situation that increased awareness of and desire to take action about problems while providing new opportunity to do so.

5. Affective Bonds: Within the cult an affective bond must be formed with one or more members, or such bonds must pre-exist. These are positive emotional relationships that attach the person to the group.

6. Neutralization of Extra-Cult Attachments: Any extra-cult attachments that might serve as counter-incentives to conversion must be absent or neutralized. This includes family, friendship, and work relationships that would oppose conversion.

7. Intensive Interaction: The person must be exposed to intensive interaction with cult members if he is to become a "deployable agent" - someone actively committed to spreading the perspective.

Conversion Types

Two classes of conversion are distinguished:
- Verbal converts: Fellow-travelers who professed belief and were accepted as sincere but took no active role
- Total converts: Those who exhibited commitment through deeds as well as words

The same factors account for both types up to a point. Verbal conversion is transformed into total conversion only when the last stage (intensive interaction) fully develops.

Sequential Logic

The conditions typically develop in the order presented, but temporal order may vary. The ordering principle is activation rather than temporal occurrence alone - the time of activation is the same whether a condition exists for considerable time prior to becoming relevant or only develops in time to accomplish conversion.

This model suggests rudiments of a general account of conversion to deviant perspectives, based on observation of a West Coast millenarian cult but potentially applicable to other cases of perspective change.
