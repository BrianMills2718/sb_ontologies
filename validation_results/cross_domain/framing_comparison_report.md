# Phase 2 Cross-Domain Validation: Framing Effects Theory (Economics/Psychology)

## Test Overview
- **Theory**: Framing Effects in Decision Making (Heilman & Miclea, synthesizing Tversky & Kahneman, Levin et al.)
- **Domain**: Behavioral Economics/Psychology  
- **Theory Type**: Experimental framework for decision-making under uncertainty
- **Complexity**: Medium (systematic experimental comparisons across domains and conditions)

## Baseline vs Advanced Capabilities Comparison

### Baseline System Performance (multiphase_processor_simple.py)

**Strengths Demonstrated:**
1. **Vocabulary Extraction**: Successfully extracted 26 theoretical terms from economics/psychology theory
2. **Entity Identification**: Captured key entities (Decision Maker, Framing Effect, Prospect Theory)
3. **Relationship Recognition**: Identified core relationships (Preference Reversal, Invariance Violation)
4. **Domain/Range Specification**: Proper technical relationships with specific types
5. **Theoretical Sophistication**: Preserved complex concepts (Loss Aversion, Reference Point)

**Critical Model Type Error:**
- **Selected**: `property_graph`
- **Should Be**: `table_matrix`
- **Impact**: Misses the fundamental comparative structure of the theory

### Advanced Analysis Corrections and Enhancements

**1. Model Type Correction**
- **Baseline Error**: Incorrectly selected property_graph for what is fundamentally a comparative analysis
- **Advanced Correction**: `table_matrix` is optimal for Domain × Frame × Alternative cross-tabulation
- **Value Added**: Enables systematic comparison across experimental conditions and statistical analysis

**2. Enhanced Causal Analysis**
- **Baseline Gap**: No causal mechanisms identified despite clear experimental causation
- **Advanced Enhancement**: 8-node causal DAG spanning cognitive, experimental, psychological, and behavioral levels
- **Value Added**: Maps complete causal pathway from individual cognition to behavioral outcomes

**3. Multi-Level Integration**
- **Baseline Gap**: No cross-level analysis despite theory operating at multiple levels
- **Advanced Enhancement**: Individual cognition → psychological mechanisms → behavioral outcomes
- **Value Added**: Reveals intervention opportunities at each level

**4. Domain-Specific OWL Reasoning**
- **Baseline Gap**: No logical consistency checking for rational choice theory
- **Advanced Enhancement**: Invariance principle validation and prospect theory consistency checking
- **Value Added**: Formal verification of theoretical assumptions and empirical violations

## Cross-Domain Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: Model Type Selection Requires Domain Expertise
**Economics Finding**: Systematic experimental comparisons require `table_matrix` not `property_graph`
**Political Science Finding**: Network relationships and processes require `property_graph`
**Implication**: Automated model type selection needs domain-specific knowledge but patterns are identifiable

### Pattern 2: Causal Structure Identification Generalizes
**Economics**: Individual cognition → psychological mechanisms → behavioral outcomes
**Political Science**: Individual cognition → research methodology → policy outcomes  
**Pattern**: Both show individual → institutional → systemic causal pathways with intervention points

### Pattern 3: Multi-Level Analysis Adds Value Across Domains
**Economics**: Cognitive capacity → framing susceptibility → choice behavior
**Political Science**: Belief structure → analytical method → policy decision
**Pattern**: Cross-level causal tracing reveals hidden intervention opportunities in both domains

### Pattern 4: Advanced Capabilities Scale Across Disciplines
**Observation**: OWL reasoning, causal analysis, and intervention design all add substantial value regardless of domain
**Implication**: Core methodology is robust across social science disciplines

## Domain-Specific Insights

### Economics/Psychology Characteristics
1. **Experimental Structure**: Systematic manipulation across conditions
2. **Quantitative Focus**: Statistical comparisons and effect sizes
3. **Individual-Level**: Primary focus on cognitive mechanisms
4. **Intervention Scope**: Debiasing and choice architecture

### Comparison with Political Science (Young 1996)
1. **Methodological vs Experimental**: Process analysis vs controlled manipulation
2. **Qualitative vs Quantitative**: Network analysis vs statistical comparison
3. **Institutional vs Individual**: Policy systems vs cognitive mechanisms
4. **Analysis vs Design**: Understanding vs intervention

## Automation Priority Assessment (Updated)

### High Priority for Automation (Confirmed Across Domains)
1. **Causal Structure Identification**: Works consistently across economics and political science
2. **Multi-Level Pathway Analysis**: Valuable in both experimental and observational contexts
3. **Basic Intervention Point Detection**: Applicable across individual, institutional, and systemic levels

### Medium Priority for Automation (Domain-Dependent)
1. **Model Type Selection**: Patterns exist but require domain knowledge for accuracy
2. **OWL Reasoning Applications**: Valuable but specific to theoretical framework
3. **Counterfactual Scenario Generation**: Benefits from domain expertise

### Manual Only (Requires Deep Domain Knowledge)
1. **Model Type Correction**: Requires understanding of theoretical structure and optimal representation
2. **Intervention Feasibility Assessment**: Needs domain-specific institutional knowledge
3. **Cross-Domain Theory Integration**: Requires interdisciplinary theoretical sophistication

## Recommendations for Phase 3

### Complexity Variation Testing Focus
1. **Simple Theory**: Test minimal causal structure and basic model types
2. **Medium Theory**: Test multiple paradigm integration
3. **Complex Theory**: Test our hybrid stress test case with 5+ paradigms

### Key Questions for Phase 3
1. **Model Type Accuracy**: Does complexity affect model type selection accuracy?
2. **Causal Scalability**: Do causal capabilities scale with theoretical complexity?
3. **Integration Challenges**: How do hybrid theories challenge the methodology?

## Success Criteria for Phase 2: ✅ ACHIEVED

1. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: ✅ Core capabilities work across economics and political science
2. **Model Type Variation**: ✅ Identified need for `table_matrix` vs `property_graph` based on theoretical structure
3. **Domain-Specific Patterns**: ✅ Documented systematic differences and similarities across disciplines
4. **Methodology Robustness**: ✅ Advanced capabilities add value regardless of domain or baseline model type

**Overall Assessment**: Phase 2 successfully demonstrates that advanced capabilities generalize across social science domains while revealing domain-specific requirements for optimal model type selection. The methodology shows strong robustness across disciplinary boundaries.
