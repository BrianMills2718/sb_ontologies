# ===============================================================================
# BASELINE SYSTEM CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT
# ===============================================================================

baseline_assessment:
  strengths:
    - "Extracted 26 theoretical terms from economics/psychology theory"
    - "Identified key entities: Decision Maker, Framing Effect, Prospect Theory"
    - "Captured core relationships: Preference Reversal, Invariance Violation"
    - "Proper domain/range specification for relationships"
    - "Preserved theoretical nuance: Loss Aversion, Reference Point"
    
  gaps_for_computational_social_science:
    - "Selected property_graph when table_matrix would be more appropriate"
    - "No explicit domain comparison structure (health vs financial vs nature)"
    - "Missing experimental design elements (within-subjects, between-subjects)"
    - "No causal mechanisms identified (framing → preference → choice)"
    - "No multi-level analysis (individual cognition → behavioral outcomes)"
    - "No intervention design for reducing framing bias"

# ===============================================================================
# MODEL TYPE CORRECTION AND JUSTIFICATION
# ===============================================================================

corrected_model_type: "table_matrix"
model_type_rationale: |
  The baseline incorrectly selected property_graph. This theory is fundamentally about 
  COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS across domains and framing conditions. The core theoretical 
  contribution is showing systematic differences in framing effects across:
  
  - Domains (health, financial, nature/objects)
  - Frame types (gain vs loss)
  - Decision alternatives (sure vs probabilistic)
  - Effect types (risky choice, attribute, goal framing)
  
  This creates a natural 3D cross-tabulation: Domain × Frame × Alternative Type
  with framing effect magnitude as the dependent variable. The theory's power comes
  from these systematic comparisons, not from network relationships.
  
  A table_matrix representation enables:
  - Systematic comparison across all conditions
  - Statistical analysis of interaction effects
  - Clear visualization of domain differences
  - Direct translation to experimental design
