annotation: This paper reviews how different verbal frames (gain vs. loss) systematically
  shift risk preferences, violating invariance and supporting Prospect Theory’s account
  of loss aversion. It catalogues framing sub-types, demonstrates domain variability,
  and highlights cognitive–emotional mechanisms behind preference reversals.

model_type: property_graph
rationale: Key concepts are discrete entities (frames, alternatives, domains), connected
  by relationships (preference reversal, loss aversion) and qualified by properties
  (risk preference, emotional reaction); a property-graph cleanly represents nodes,
  edges, and attributes.
