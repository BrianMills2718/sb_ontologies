Framing Effects Theory in Decision Making
Based on Heilman & Miclea research

Core Theory

The framing effect refers to presenting equivalent decisional alternatives in different terms, resulting in preference for one alternative over the other, depending on the description format. This represents a violation of the principle of invariance, a cornerstone of decision maker's rationality.

Principle of Invariance: A preference for a decisional option should be independent of the terms in which it is described (Tversky & Kahneman, 1986). Different wordings should not influence the decision maker's preference for a particular alternative.

However, people lack the computational resources to make decisions consistent with economic rationality (Simon, 1955). People are prone to predictable sources of distortion (Kahneman, 2011).

Asian Disease Problem

The classic demonstration involves a hypothetical disease affecting 600 people. Decision-makers choose between two intervention programs described either in:
- Gain terms: how many people will be saved
- Loss terms: how many people will die

Each frame presents:
- Sure alternative: specific number who will surely survive/die  
- Probabilistic alternative: probabilities that all people survive/die

Results show preference reversal:
- Loss frame: 78% choose probabilistic alternative (risk seeking)
- Gain frame: 28% choose probabilistic alternative (risk aversion)

Taxonomy of Framing Effects (Levin et al., 1998)

1. Risky Choice Framing: Different formulations applied to decisional alternatives involving varying risk levels. Shows preference reversal between sure and probabilistic outcomes.

2. Attribute Framing: Characteristics of objects/events are differently formulated. Affects how objects are evaluated based on descriptive valence.

3. Goal Framing: Manipulation applied to formulation of behavioral goals. Highlights benefits of performing action vs. risks of not performing.

Prospect Theory Explanation

Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) explains framing effects through:
- Evaluation of outcomes as gains/losses relative to baseline
- Loss aversion: losses loom larger than equivalent gains
- Greater sensitivity to losses than comparable gains
- Negatively framed information has more impact than positive

Domain Differences

Framing effects vary across decisional domains:
- Health domain: Strong framing effects present
- Financial domain: No significant framing effects
- Nature/objects domain: Framing effects present
- Within-domain variation: Different problems show varying effect magnitudes

Emotional reactions triggered by decisional problems may explain domain differences.

Theoretical Components

Decision Maker: Individual making choices under uncertainty
Decisional Alternative: Option available for selection
Frame: Terms used to describe alternatives (gain vs. loss)
Reference Point: Baseline for evaluating outcomes as gains/losses
Risk Preference: Tendency toward risk seeking vs. risk aversion
Preference Reversal: Change in choice pattern due to framing
Invariance Violation: Failure to maintain consistent preferences across equivalent descriptions
Economic Rationality: Normative standard for optimal decision making
Loss Aversion: Greater sensitivity to losses than equivalent gains
Prospect Theory: Descriptive theory of decision making under risk
